ACT ONE CLOSE ON: A LANDSCAPE.
Sand colored, stretching to a horizon of black.
Very serene.
And then we see a bead of red, rolling like a teardrop, and we realize this is no landscape.
It's a body.
A GLOVED HAND reaches into a ziplock bag and withdraws a fistful of rose petals.
The petals tumble slowly through space, landing on naked skin.
We follow the gloved hand as it picks up bloody clothing from the floor and stuffs it into a plastic bag.
Bag in hand, the killer leaves the room.
We're left looking at the victim, a YOUNG WOMAN IN HER EARLY TWENTIES, staring out at us with lifeless eyes.
And we hear a woman's voice whisper: Murder .. WOMAN'S VOICE-LRB- OVER-RRB- CUT TO: EXT..
ROOFTOP, PUBLISHING PARTY- NIGHT This is not your Daddy's publishing party.
Waiter dressed as murder victims serve drinks, while hardcore hotties mingle with middle-aged men.
Mystery... WOMAN'S VOICE-LRB- OVER-RRB- A hush falls over the crowd.
Around the room, GIANT PLACARDS display the PHOTOGRAPH of a handsome, roguish man- NICK CASTLE- and advertise his latest potboiler,`` STORM'S END.''
WOMAN'S VOICE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB- The macabre.
The woman, standing at the podium in front of the crowd, is GINA COWELL, 39 and holding.
She's the President of Black Pawn Publishing.
GINA What is it about a dark and stormy night that sets our pulses racing?
What is it about a hard-boiled detective, a femme fatale, and the cold steel of a gun that keeps our bedside lamps glowing until the wee hours of the morning?
Marlowe- Castle Pilot- 02.29.08- 2.
Waiting nearby is NICK CASTLE himself, late-thirties and a rock star of the literary world.
Dressed in jeans, leather, and three days growth, he's the kind of trouble every woman hopes to find.
And a couple of them have, much to his delight.
BLONDE Are you really Nick Castle?
CASTLE Are you really a blonde?
And somehow from Nick, it sounds charming.
Back at the podium GINA However the spell is cast, tonight we honor one of the masters of the form and celebrate the launch of`` Storm's End,'' the stunning conclusion to his best-selling Derrick Storm mystery series.
Castle holds a SHARPIE at the ready as one giggling young beauty pulls her dress top aside to reveal a beautiful lace bra tastefully covering her breast.
Castle grins and signs his name just above the bra line.
CASTLE Call me when you're ready to wash it.
Gina glances over in time to witness this.
A fleeting glimpse of disapproval crosses her face.
GINA Ladies and gentlemen, the Master of the Macabre... Nick Castle.
Nick Castle trots up onstage to the applause of the audience.
He and Gina exchange a kiss.
Pig.
GINA-LRB- CONT'D-RRB--LRB- sotto-RRB- CASTLE-LRB- sotto-RRB- Witch.
The smile never leaves either of their faces.
CASTLE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB- Gina Cowell everyone.
President of Black Pawn Publishing.
Another round of applause.
Marlowe- Castle Pilot- 02.29.08- 3.
CASTLE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB--LRB- cutting-RRB- Is n't she something.
Castle looks out on the audience.
CASTLE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB- You know, on the way over here tonight, it occured to me... Detective Storm and I have been together longer than both my marriages put together.
And when I thought of it that way, it made me realize something.
He pauses dramatically.
Moved.
Almost teary.
And then... CASTLE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB--LRB- all smiles-RRB- No wonder I'm ready to move on.
Laughter from the crowd.
CASTLE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB- Seriously.
It's been a great ride.
The book's a great read.
And I look forward to seeing you all back here after I've spilled more ink and blood.
CUT TO: FLASH.
FLASH.
FLASH.
Gina and Castle stand for the photographers.
Gina speaks through her gritted smile.
GINA What kind of idiot kills off a bestselling main character?
CASTLE Are you asking as my blood-sucking publisher or my blood-sucking ex-wife?
The Photographer nods thanks.
Immediately, the smiles drop.
GINA Is that what you're doing?
Punishing me by killing the golden goose?
CASTLE I may be petty and short-sighted, but I'm not that petty and short-sighted.
Marlowe- Castle Pilot- 02.29.08- 4.
GINA Then for godsakes why?
As they move through crowd, people hand Castle books to sign.
CASTLE I told you, I was bored.
GINA You do n't kill a billion dollar franchise because you're bored.
CASTLE He was n't fun anymore.
Writing him was like... Work.
GINA God forbid you work.
You could've retired him, crippled him, had him join a frickin' circus!
But no..
You put a bullet through his head.
CASTLE Big exit wound too.
Real messy.
Like Cortez burning his ships.
He grabs a glass of champagne for a passing tray.
CASTLE-LRB- CONT'D-RRB- Besides, Derrick Storm is n't the Golden Goose.
I am.
I wrote half a dozen best-sellers before him.
What makes you think I'll stop now?
GINA Oh I do n't know.
The fact the new book was due nine weeks ago?
CASTLE You ca n't rush genius.
Gina pulls him aside.
