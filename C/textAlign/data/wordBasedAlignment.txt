<1> : save shelly. 
<2> : save shelly. 
<3> : why, who in the world let major briggs loose, leo? 
<4> : lt couldn't have been you, could it? 
<5> : no, no. no punishment, leo. 
<6> : lt's too late for that to do us any harm. 
<7> : and l have a new game for you. 
<8> : well, here's our contribution to the miss twin peaks gala buffet. 
<9> : and l fully expect to see one of you up there in the winner's circle. 
<10> : - dream on, norma. - don't be so sure. 
<11> : this is the biggest day of the year for us. 
<12> : and we have to have somebody up there 
<13> : who really deserves this title. 
<14> : especially this year. 
<15> : you mean laura palmer? 
<16> : lt would be a good day for healing. 
<17> : l think we need more than a day. 
<18> : so, norma, are they gonna honor you tonight 
<19> : on your 20th anniversary of winning miss twin peaks? 
<20> : don't remind me. 
<21> : come on, if you entered today, you'd win. 
<22> : look at you, you're already working on the judge. 
<23> : well, since you mentioned it... 
<24> : who are you gonna vote for? 
<25> : maybe you could split your vote. 
<26> : - hi, daddy. - audrey. 
<27> : the most intelligent face that l've seen all day. 
<28> : you make the rest of us look like primates. 
<29> : what's with all the books? 
<30> : yes, the koran, 
<31> : the bhagavad-gita, the talmud, 
<32> : the bible, old and new testaments, 
<33> : the tao te ching. 
<34> : audrey, l hold in my hands those holy books 
<35> : which constitute the fundamental framework 
<36> : of humanity's philosophy of good. 
<37> : somewhere in here are the answers that l seek. 
<38> : and l intend to read them from cover to cover, until l find... 
<39> : listen to me prattling on. 
<40> : lt's jack, isn't it? 
<41> : lt's only been a day. 
<42> : l hope it doesn't hurt this much in a week. 
<43> : honey, may l give you a piece of ageless wisdom 
<44> : culled from these volumes? 
<45> : time heals all wounds. 
<46> : l know how it feels. 
<47> : believe me. 
<48> : we barely had time to know each other. 
<49> : but the time that you had was highly concentrated. 
<50> : lt's the concentrate they make concentrate from. 
<51> : l'm afraid l'll never see him again. 
<52> : jack is a man of his word. 
<53> : and if he said that he'd be back, then he will be back. 
<54> : l promise you. 
<55> : daddy, you can't promise me, but thanks for wanting to. 
<56> : l actually came here to update you on my trip to seattle. 
<57> : right. update away. 
<58> : okay. 
<59> : the packards are using twin peaks savings and loan 
<60> : to funnel cash to the ghostwood project. 
<61> : but the bank is keeping a very low profile. 
<62> : lt seems they don't want any bad publicity. 
<63> : oh, they don't? 
<64> : well, bad publicity is exactly what they're gonna get. 
<65> : audrey, have you given any more thought 
<66> : to the miss twin peaks pageant? 
<67> : daddy... 
<68> : from the bottom of my heart, 
<69> : l don't wanna be the town bathing beauty. 
<70> : l understand. 
<71> : but miss twin peaks is the ultimate local forum. 
<72> : audrey. 
<73> : lt would truly be inspirational 
<74> : to have a winner with a political sensibility 
<75> : that extends beyond makeup strategies 
<76> : and recipes for cherry pie, huh? 
<77> : now, as you know, 
<78> : each contestant gives a speech to the assembled town. 
<79> : this year's theme concerns our immediate environment. 
<80> : and what we must do to preserve it. 
<81> : l know there's another way to do this, daddy. 
<82> : audrey, make the speech. 
<83> : help stop ghostwood. 
<84> : and take us to a better day. 
<85> : has he taken his eyes off it yet? 
<86> : not today. 
<87> : and before you ask, 
<88> : we still got people out combing the woods for major briggs. 
<89> : harry, considering our mutual connection to project blue book, 
<90> : l believe that windom earle has targeted the major. 
<91> : - what for? - lnteresting. 
<92> : l don't know. 
<93> : but with your permission, l'd like to speak out loud. 
<94> : windom earle has been seeking access to the black lodge 
<95> : as far back as 1 965. 
<96> : this chess game may involve 
<97> : more pieces than we've begun to imagine. 
<98> : then of course, there's the mysterious circumstances 
<99> : surrounding josie's death to consider. 
<100> : what about them? consider them how? 
<101> : when she died-- l'm sorry l didn't mention this before, harry, 
<102> : but l had to take into account your mental state. 
<103> : what is it? 
<104> : she was trembling with fear. 
<105> : l would go as far as to say quaking like an animal. 
<106> : l might venture a guess to say that it was the fear that killed her. 
<107> : at the moment of her death... 
<108> : ...l saw bob. 
<109> : as if he had slipped in through some crevice in time. 
<110> : upon reflection, l believe there's a connection 
<111> : between his appearance and josie's fear. 
<112> : as if he was attracted to it. 
<113> : feeding off it somehow. 
<114> : you see a connection between bob and the black lodge? 
<115> : harry, l think it's where he comes from. 
<116> : l think that the black lodge is what you have referred to in the past 
<117> : as ''the evil in these woods.'' 
<118> : lf windom earle is seeking access to that, 
<119> : it is imperative that we find our way in before he does. 
<120> : there's a source of great power there, harry. 
<121> : far beyond our ability to comprehend. 
<122> : eureka! 
<123> : dale, l could kiss your pointy little head. 
<124> : lt's fear. 
<125> : lt's fear, leo. that's the key. 
<126> : my favorite emotional state. 
<127> : and all this time, it's been staring me right in the kisser. 
<128> : leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit. 
<129> : these night creatures that hover on the edge of our nightmares 
<130> : are drawn to us when we radiate fear. 
<131> : lt's their bread and butter. 
<132> : a perfect symbiosis. 
<133> : oh, nature, perfect in design and aspects. 
<134> : you do not disappoint! 
<135> : leo, look lively. 
<136> : victory is at hand. 
<137> : we know where the entrance is. we know when the lock appears. 
<138> : now we hold the key in our hands. 
<139> : forgive my hasty departure, dear one. 
<140> : the time has come to gather my beloved queen 
<141> : and embark upon our dark honeymoon. 
<142> : l haven't been this excited since l punctured caroline's aorta. 
<143> : leo, we must share a final sentiment. 
<144> : during our time together in this verdant bower, 
<145> : l must confess, l've developed something of a fondness for you. 
<146> : sounding board, companion, 
<147> : ever obedient and faithful. 
<148> : an overall a for effort, leo. 
<149> : but l'm still a trifle miffed at your release of major briggs. 
<150> : but then, you'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, won't you? 
<151> : goodbye, leo. 
<152> : and good luck. 
<153> : one and two and three, step four. 
<154> : and one and two-- let the mood carry you. 
<155> : don't be afraid of your vulnerability. show me more leg. 
<156> : what kind of a dance is this supposed to be, mr. pinkle? 
<157> : lt's a dance of nature, my friend. 
<158> : lt's a celebration. all right, girls. 
<159> : now, turn around and bend forward 
<160> : like a sapling. a sapling in the wind. 
<161> : that's it. a little bit more, and hold it. 
<162> : what exactly are we celebrating with us all bending over like this? 
<163> : don't ever question the vision of your choreographer! 
<164> : you are but a petal on my rose. 
<165> : now, please, people. on the count of one. 
<166> : one and two and three and four. 
<167> : and one and two 
<168> : - and three and four... - l love a chorus line. 
<169> : lf we could just focus here for a second. 
<170> : l've gotta get back to the diner. 
<171> : now, what qualities do we think best exemplify miss twin peaks? 
<172> : beauty and power. 
<173> : that's the way l like them. 
<174> : poise and, god help us, a sophistication 
<175> : and breeding. 
<176> : well, l think a major factor should be originality. 
<177> : well, wouldn't that fall under talent? 
<178> : lt's always nice when it does. 
<179> : personally, l've always been big on style. 
<180> : l think this is enough for me to work with, 
<181> : so l'm gonna go back and work up the scoresheets, 
<182> : and l'll see you tonight. 
<183> : - terrific. - bye. 
<184> : and three and four. 
<185> : okay, that's a break, team. 
<186> : hi, dick. we're on break. 
<187> : hi, lana. 
<188> : would you mind helping me find something in the storage room? 
<189> : storage room? 
<190> : we're missing a very important prop. 
<191> : come on. 
<192> : l'm having trouble. 
<193> : well, just flick it. 
<194> : now, what exactly did you need to find? 
<195> : - lana? - oh, did l do that? 
<196> : what are you looking for? 
<197> : well, now, l don't know the exact technical name for it, but... 
<198> : does anything--? does anything in here look like it? 
<199> : oh, l think this might be it. 
<200> : oh, by george, l think you've got it. 
<201> : diane, it's 1 :1 7 p.m. l have just concluded 
<202> : my second meditation of the day in lieu of sleep. 
<203> : and l feel completely refreshed and struck again by the realization 
<204> : that all of us on this great big planet earth 
<205> : live at only a fraction of our potential. 
<206> : we are working round the clock on the cave petroglyph. 
<207> : l am certain that the answers lie in this mysterious etching. 
<208> : l am also convinced that windom earle 
<209> : is searching for exactly the same thing as we are 
<210> : for diametrically opposite reasons. 
<211> : lf l'm correct in my assumptions about the power of this unholy place, 
<212> : god help us if he gets there first. 
<213> : diane, at this particular juncture, 
<214> : l would like to make specific mention of annie blackburn. 
<215> : she is a completely original human being. 
<216> : her responses, as pure as those of a child. 
<217> : l must be honest, l haven't felt this way about a woman since caroline. 
<218> : lt has taken meeting annie for me to realize 
<219> : how gray my life has been since caroline's death. 
<220> : how cold and solitary. 
<221> : although occasionally, 
<222> : there is something to be said for solitude. 
<223> : annie blackburn, you have almost perfect timing. 
<224> : that's not what our choreographer says. 
<225> : what can l do for you? 
<226> : well, l need to give a speech in six hours. 
<227> : l haven't written a word, 
<228> : and l don't have any idea what l wanna say. 
<229> : l'm in a complete sweaty-palmed panic, 
<230> : and l need to talk to someone, namely you. 
<231> : what's your topic? 
<232> : what you can do to save our local forests. 
<233> : l just don't wanna stand up there like some deranged barbie doll, 
<234> : saying things like, ''make sure your campfires are out, 
<235> : kind of like my brain.'' 
<236> : - you're terrified of public speaking. - yes. 
<237> : all right, well... 
<238> : ...our forests need saving because of the way people regard them. 
<239> : expendable. 
<240> : lf the ghostwood development cost thousands of lives, 
<241> : do you think it would have a chance of going forward? 
<242> : well, trees aren't the same as people. 
<243> : but they are alive. 
<244> : your forest is beautiful and peaceful. 
<245> : part of it's been damaged. 
<246> : l've tried to replant, but nothing's taken root. 
<247> : every forest has its shadow. 
<248> : l can see half my life's history in your face, 
<249> : and l'm not sure that l want to. 
<250> : l don't wanna talk about trees anymore. 
<251> : all l know is, l wanna make love with you. 
<252> : and this is me with last year's regional champion from yakima. 
<253> : he was cute, but a little slow. next. 
<254> : oh, and this is me with brock farmington, 
<255> : triple-a champion from spokane. 
<256> : superior upper-body strength, 
<257> : and quads like bridge supports. 
<258> : l pinned him in a minute five. 
<259> : next. 
<260> : oh, this is me with all the stuff l won. 
<261> : - that's nice. - way to go. 
<262> : thank you, nadine. 
<263> : well, now, 
<264> : l suppose all of you are wondering just why we've gathered here today. 
<265> : see, l learned that when a couple is contemplating div-- 
<266> : breaking up, 
<267> : well, sometimes it's easier to talk about our feelings 
<268> : when we're around other people. 
<269> : so, nadine, maybe you'd like to begin. 
<270> : okay. 
<271> : well, l guess it all started 
<272> : when l noticed mike's buns in the hall at school. 
<273> : yes. 
<274> : well, how are you feeling now? 
<275> : well, a little guilty, l guess. 
<276> : l mean, mike and l are hot. 
<277> : and miss twin peaks is tonight, 
<278> : and mr. pinkle thinks l'm a show-business natural. 
<279> : well, l mean, because l'm so happy, 
<280> : l worry about ed being sad. 
<281> : ed, is there something that you'd like to tell nadine? 
<282> : nadine... 
<283> : ...norma and l plan on getting married. 
<284> : really? 
<285> : well, that's wonderful, eddie, 
<286> : because mike and me are getting married too. 
<287> : which way is the castle? 
<288> : - l waited for you. - thanks, harry. 
<289> : not that he's too talkative. 
<290> : he checks out okay physically. doc ran some blood tests. 
<291> : he's been shot full of haloperidol. 
<292> : right. 
<293> : garland? 
<294> : did windom earle do this to you? 
<295> : garland? 
<296> : odd name. 
<297> : judy garland? 
<298> : was it windom earle? 
<299> : lt was god, l suppose. 
<300> : garland, where did he take you? 
<301> : the woods? 
<302> : can you be more specific? 
<303> : they were lovely. 
<304> : dark. the king of romania was unable to attend. 
<305> : harry, this is gonna take some time. 
<306> : - how much time we got? - not enough. 
<307> : let's leave him here with us. maybe something will bubble up. 
<308> : harry, we're in trouble. 
<309> : lf the door to the black lodge does exist, 
<310> : it probably exists at a point in time. 
<311> : now, an object, such as a door, 
<312> : normally exists at a point in time and space. 
<313> : by way of contrast, 
<314> : a shooting star normally exists at a point in time 
<315> : over a continuum of space. 
<316> : but taken from the star's point of view, it's a completely different experience. 
<317> : you just lost me. 
<318> : lf we're not at the right place at exactly the right time, 
<319> : we won't find our way in. 
<320> : sheriff? 
<321> : could the four-h club have anything to do with all of this? 
<322> : doubtful, andy. 
<323> : this has to be the last box. look at it. 
<324> : l can't take any more of this. 
<325> : boxes inside boxes. 
<326> : whatever is in that better be worth a fortune. 
<327> : maybe it's not a box at all. 
<328> : maybe it's just a block of stainless steel. 
<329> : - eckhardt's last little joke. - lt'd be a good one. 
<330> : let's channel some of that high wit into the job. 
<331> : again. 
<332> : l can't believe a little crumb like that 
<333> : can stand up to this cram jack all-duty vise. 
<334> : on three. one, two and three! 
<335> : l'm sorry, andrew. that was my fault. 
<336> : dumb boxes! 
<337> : andrew! 
<338> : darn boxes. 
<339> : nice shooting, andrew. 
<340> : look at that. 
<341> : a key! 
<342> : and where there's a key, there's a lock. 
<343> : lt should be kept safe. 
<344> : yes, in plain sight. 
<345> : you two don't trust each other? 
<346> : of course we do. 
<347> : like brother, like sister. 
<348> : how about here? 
<349> : ln the cake saver. 
<350> : ln plain sight. 
<351> : - so we have a key. - yes, we do. 
<352> : you look truly beautiful. 
<353> : read us your speech. 
<354> : l'd rather talk about the truth right now. 
<355> : what truth is that? 
<356> : l know something's going on with you and benjamin horne, 
<357> : and l wanna know what it is. 
<358> : donna, don't talk to your mother like that. 
<359> : you know, l'm really tired of you talking to me like l'm a child. 
<360> : l wanna know what's going on. 
<361> : donna, l understand your feeling. 
<362> : but there are some things you just have to trust. 
<363> : you're young and you don't know all the limitations. 
<364> : l know the limitations of lying. 
<365> : l know that you raised me to tell the truth. 
<366> : l expect the same from you. 
<367> : lf you're not gonna tell me what l need to know, 
<368> : l'll find out from benjamin horne. 
<369> : - no. - then tell me. 
<370> : all right, this is your choice, not mine. 
<371> : donna. 
<372> : donna! 
<373> : by heavens. 
<374> : andy, take a look at this. 
<375> : what you mistook for the four-h club, 
<376> : the four and the h, are actually astrological symbols. 
<377> : - you mean, like planets? - why, yes, andy. 
<378> : they stand for jupiter and saturn. 
<379> : some of the others represent planets as well, 
<380> : but this particular part of the puzzle pertains to a precise planetary position. 
<381> : - jupiter and saturn in conjunction. - what's that supposed to mean? 
<382> : well, historically, harry, when jupiter and saturn are conjunct, 
<383> : there are enormous shifts in power and fortune. 
<384> : jupiter being expansive in its influence, 
<385> : saturn, contractive. 
<386> : conjunction suggests a state of intensification, concentration. 
<387> : what this indicates to me is the potential for explosive change, 
<388> : - good and bad. - so when's the next conjunction? 
<389> : well, now, let's see. 
<390> : according to the ephemeris... 
<391> : ...the next conjunction is due january to june. 
<392> : my god, harry. 
<393> : the door to the lodge. 
<394> : that's when it's open. that's what the puzzle is telling us. 
<395> : lt's telling us when it's gonna be open. 
<396> : protect the queen. 
<397> : lf it's telling us when, then it must also tell us where. 
<398> : fear and love open the doors. 
<399> : what's he saying? 
<400> : he said, ''fear and love open the doors.'' 
<401> : two doors, two lodges. 
<402> : fear opens one, the black. 
<403> : - love, the other. - what's that mean? 
<404> : l don't know exactly. lt just came to me. 
<405> : how does the queen--? 
<406> : - of course, the queen. - of romania? 
<407> : no. the chess game's final piece. harry, follow my logic. 
<408> : - lf windom earle takes the queen-- - game's not over till he takes the king. 
<409> : that depends. maybe he takes her to the doorway when it opens. 
<410> : - which queen are we talking about? - agent cooper. 
<411> : just a minute, andy. 
<412> : the queen. the queen. the crown. the queen. 
<413> : - harry, the queen. - agent cooper? 
<414> : andy, please. 
<415> : harry, miss twin peaks. 
<416> : - holy smokes, that's it. - yeah. yeah. 
<417> : agent cooper, please. 
<418> : andy. 
<419> : coop, the plant's been bugged. 
<420> : this bonsai isn't from josie, harry. 
<421> : this bonsai's from windom earle. 
<422> : he's way ahead of us, 
<423> : and we've been working for him from the beginning. 
<424> : - what time does that contest start? - any minute. 
<425> : let's go. 
<426> : agent cooper. agent cooper! 
<427> : welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 
<428> : l hope you've had a good weekend. 
<429> : and welcome to the miss twin peaks pageant, 
<430> : in which one of these lovely and talented young citizens 
<431> : will soon be crowned miss twin peaks. 
<432> : and now, commencing our talent section of the show, 
<433> : lucy moran. 
<434> : come on. 
<435> : small town, man. 
<436> : so, what, did you bring your whole family? 
<437> : we're pulling in deputies from all over to surround the place. 
<438> : they should be here any time. 
<439> : harry, it is essential whoever wins this contest receive 24-hour guard, 
<440> : house security, l want the works. 
<441> : as soon as she's announced. 
<442> : our next entry is lana budding-milford, 
<443> : who will perform a dance of... 
<444> : ...contortionistic jazz exotica. 
<445> : - lana? - agent coop-- 
<446> : there, my friend, is a real artist. 
<447> : there is only one way to save a forest, an idea, or anything of value. 
<448> : and that is by refusing to stand by and watch it die. 
<449> : there is a law of nature, which is more fundamental to life 
<450> : than the laws of man. 
<451> : and when something you care about is in danger, 
<452> : you must fight to save it 
<453> : or lose it forever. 
<454> : thank you. 
<455> : thank you, audrey horne. 
<456> : now a brief musical interlude. 
<457> : thanks, daddy. 
<458> : l'm gonna go out there. 
<459> : l wanna know what's going on with you and my mother. 
<460> : donna. 
<461> : l think the wisest course would be, 
<462> : first of all, just to get together and talk about this. 
<463> : l don't think so. 
<464> : donna, l really don't think this is the time or the place. 
<465> : old pictures, horne bearer bonds in the attic, 
<466> : love letters to my mom. 
<467> : l want to tell the truth. l want to do the right thing. 
<468> : a birth certificate with no father's name on it. 
<469> : what the hell's going on here, mr. horne? 
<470> : why won't anyone tell me the truth? 
<471> : donna. 
<472> : your mother and l... 
<473> : you're my father? 
<474> : donna. 
<475> : and to illustrate my point, 
<476> : l'd like to quote these words from chief seattle, 
<477> : leader of the suquamish tribe: 
<478> : ''your dead are soon forgotten and never return. 
<479> : our dead never forget the beautiful world that gave them being. 
<480> : they still love its verdant valleys, 
<481> : its murmuring rivers, its majestic mountains. 
<482> : when the last red man has vanished from this earth, 
<483> : these forests and shores will still hold their spirits.'' 
<484> : for the lndians love the earth 
<485> : as a newborn loves its mother's heartbeat. 
<486> : why have we all lost touch with this beauty? 
<487> : maybe saving a forest starts with preserving some of the feelings 
<488> : that die inside us every day. 
<489> : those parts of ourselves that we deny. 
<490> : for if we cannot respect that interior land, 
<491> : then neither can we respect the land we walk. 
<492> : so let us, in walking gently upon the earth, 
<493> : leave behind a simple legacy. 
<494> : that we're new warriors, 
<495> : mystic warriors who love the earth 
<496> : and tried to save it. 
<497> : thank you very much. 
<498> : thanks to all our contestants. 
<499> : balloting will now commence, and we will then announce our winner. 
<500> : have you both forgotten what day this is? 
<501> : miss twin peaks day? 
<502> : today is the day my unborn child receives a dad. 
<503> : lt was right on the tip of my tongue. 
<504> : l have decided 
<505> : that regardless of which individual is biologically responsible, 
<506> : that l want andy to be the father of my child. 
<507> : really? 
<508> : l'm sorry, dick, but l just have to do what's best for little what's-his-name. 
<509> : oh, no, not at all. a sound choice. 
<510> : heartiest congratulations, dearest andrew. 
<511> : now, if you'll both excuse me, l do have a vote to cast myself. 
<512> : here's to the children. 
<513> : don't sound so disappointed. 
<514> : my god, lucy. 
<515> : l'm so honored you made this decision. 
<516> : and l promise l'll be a great father. 
<517> : but right now

<523> : ...annie blackburn. 
<524> : ladies and gentlemen, your new miss twin peaks! 
<525> : this is an outrage. 
<526> : she's been living in this town about 1 5 minutes. 
<527> : and what the hell got into you? 
<528> : she gave a beautiful speech. 
<529> : lnherent in her message were words 
<530> : even the most craven of us can ill afford to ignore. 
<531> : what's happening? 
<532> : everybody, please, please stay calm. 
<533> : good lord. 
<534> : this way. 
<535> : settle down. everybody settle down. don't panic! this way. 
<536> : l will help you.

<538> : annie? 
<539> : annie? 
<540> : - harry. - what? 
<541> : - he took annie. - what? 
<542> : he got annie. 
<543> : bastard. he won't get half a mile from here. we'll get him. 
<544> : agent cooper, l've been looking all over for you. 
<545> : andy, they're gonna need you outside. 
<546> : this is important. 
<547> : that cave painting in the office, l finally figured it out. 
<548> : - what? - l knew l'd seen it someplace before.
