1
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,098
Save Shelly.

2
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,033
Save Shelly.

3
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,810
Why, who in the world
let Major Briggs loose, Leo?

4
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:03,847
lt couldn't have been you, could it?

5
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,594
No, no. No punishment, Leo.

6
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,821
lt's too late for that
to do us any harm.

7
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,692
And l have a new game for you.

8
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:36,253
Well, here's our contribution
to the Miss Twin Peaks gala buffet.

9
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,914
And l fully expect to see one of you
up there in the winner's circle.

10
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,620
- Dream on, Norma.
- Don't be so sure.

11
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,855
This is the biggest day of the year
for us.

12
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,624
And we have to have somebody
up there

13
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,392
who really deserves this title.

14
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:50,831
Especially this year.

15
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,399
You mean Laura Palmer?

16
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,234
lt would be a good day for healing.

17
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,937
l think we need more than a day.

18
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:02,547
So, Norma, are they gonna
honor you tonight

19
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,981
on your 20th anniversary
of winning Miss Twin Peaks?

20
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:07,619
Don't remind me.

21
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:10,585
Come on,
if you entered today, you'd win.

22
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,255
Look at you,
you're already working on the judge.

23
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,095
Well, since you mentioned it...

24
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,924
Who are you gonna vote for?

25
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,590
Maybe you could split your vote.

26
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,974
- Hi, Daddy.
- Audrey.

27
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,114
The most intelligent face
that l've seen all day.

28
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:42,780
You make the rest of us
look like primates.

29
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,453
What's with all the books?

30
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,619
Yes, the Koran,

31
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,690
the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud,

32
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,957
the Bible, Old and New Testaments,

33
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,995
the Tao Te Ching.

34
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,801
Audrey, l hold in my hands
those holy books

35
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,136
which constitute
the fundamental framework

36
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,801
of humanity's
philosophy of good.

37
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,383
Somewhere in here
are the answers that l seek.

38
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:17,217
And l intend to read them
from cover to cover, until l find...

39
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,487
Listen to me prattling on.

40
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,424
lt's Jack, isn't it?

41
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,161
lt's only been a day.

42
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,662
l hope it doesn't hurt this much
in a week.

43
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,210
Honey, may l give you
a piece of ageless wisdom

44
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,473
culled from these volumes?

45
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,980
Time heals all wounds.

46
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:49,386
l know how it feels.

47
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,353
Believe me.

48
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:55,989
We barely had time
to know each other.

49
00:06:56,596 --> 00:07:01,033
But the time that you had
was highly concentrated.

50
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:06,270
lt's the concentrate
they make concentrate from.

51
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:12,039
l'm afraid l'll never see him again.

52
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,871
Jack is a man of his word.

53
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:19,382
And if he said that he'd be back,
then he will be back.

54
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:22,112
l promise you.

55
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:26,622
Daddy, you can't promise me,
but thanks for wanting to.

56
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:31,094
l actually came here
to update you on my trip to Seattle.

57
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,794
Right. Update away.

58
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,066
Okay.

59
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,933
The Packards are using
Twin Peaks Savings and Loan

60
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,404
to funnel cash
to the Ghostwood project.

61
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:45,874
But the bank is keeping
a very low profile.

62
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,378
lt seems they don't want
any bad publicity.

63
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,944
Oh, they don't?

64
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,878
Well, bad publicity
is exactly what they're gonna get.

65
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,516
Audrey, have you given
any more thought

66
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,752
to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant?

67
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,065
Daddy...

68
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,429
From the bottom of my heart,

69
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,970
l don't wanna be
the town bathing beauty.

70
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,164
l understand.

71
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:20,569
But Miss Twin Peaks
is the ultimate local forum.

72
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,808
Audrey.

73
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:27,847
lt would truly be inspirational

74
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:31,182
to have a winner
with a political sensibility

75
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,688
that extends
beyond makeup strategies

76
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,763
and recipes for cherry pie, huh?

77
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,991
Now, as you know,

78
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,967
each contestant gives a speech
to the assembled town.

79
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:49,006
This year's theme concerns
our immediate environment.

80
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,770
And what we must do to preserve it.

81
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:56,143
l know there's another way to do this,
Daddy.

82
00:08:56,316 --> 00:09:00,116
Audrey, make the speech.

83
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:03,346
Help stop Ghostwood.

84
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:07,391
And take us to a better day.

85
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,492
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?

86
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,499
Not today.

87
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,199
And before you ask,

88
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,864
we still got people out
combing the woods for Major Briggs.

89
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:26,305
Harry, considering our mutual
connection to Project Blue Book,

90
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,572
l believe that Windom Earle
has targeted the major.

91
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,717
- What for?
- lnteresting.

92
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,348
l don't know.

93
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:40,559
But with your permission,
l'd like to speak out loud.

94
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:43,722
Windom Earle has been
seeking access to the Black Lodge

95
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,990
as far back as 1 965.

96
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:47,763
This chess game may involve

97
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,162
more pieces
than we've begun to imagine.

98
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,395
Then of course,
there's the mysterious circumstances

99
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,130
surrounding Josie's death
to consider.

100
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,738
What about them?
Consider them how?

101
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,107
When she died-- l'm sorry
l didn't mention this before, Harry,

102
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,272
but l had to take into account
your mental state.

103
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,574
What is it?

104
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,683
She was trembling with fear.

105
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,154
l would go as far as to say
quaking like an animal.

106
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,752
l might venture a guess to say
that it was the fear that killed her.

107
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,453
At the moment of her death...

108
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,959
...l saw Bob.

109
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,295
As if he had slipped in
through some crevice in time.

110
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,370
Upon reflection, l believe
there's a connection

111
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,302
between his appearance
and Josie's fear.

112
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,873
As if he was attracted to it.

113
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,608
Feeding off it somehow.

114
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,537
You see a connection
between Bob and the Black Lodge?

115
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,983
Harry,
l think it's where he comes from.

116
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:43,212
l think that the Black Lodge
is what you have referred to in the past

117
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,119
as ''the evil in these woods.''

118
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,556
lf Windom Earle is seeking access
to that,

119
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,891
it is imperative that we find our way in
before he does.

120
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,430
There's a source of great power there,
Harry.

121
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:58,635
Far beyond our ability
to comprehend.

122
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,773
Eureka!

123
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:08,208
Dale, l could kiss
your pointy little head.

124
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,250
lt's fear.

125
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,511
lt's fear, Leo. That's the key.

126
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,417
My favorite emotional state.

127
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,356
And all this time,
it's been staring me right in the kisser.

128
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:25,293
Leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit.

129
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,093
These night creatures that hover
on the edge of our nightmares

130
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:31,498
are drawn to us
when we radiate fear.

131
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,434
lt's their bread and butter.

132
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,597
A perfect symbiosis.

133
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,802
Oh, nature,
perfect in design and aspects.

134
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,379
You do not disappoint!

135
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,675
Leo, look lively.

136
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:47,447
Victory is at hand.

137
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,454
We know where the entrance is.
We know when the lock appears.

138
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:56,755
Now we hold the key in our hands.

139
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:02,490
Forgive my hasty departure,
dear one.

140
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:07,401
The time has come
to gather my beloved queen

141
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:10,906
and embark
upon our dark honeymoon.

142
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,808
l haven't been this excited
since l punctured Caroline's aorta.

143
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:22,821
Leo, we must share
a final sentiment.

144
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:26,356
During our time together
in this verdant bower,

145
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:31,395
l must confess, l've developed
something of a fondness for you.

146
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:35,591
Sounding board, companion,

147
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,828
ever obedient and faithful.

148
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:42,099
An overall A for effort, Leo.

149
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:46,404
But l'm still a trifle miffed
at your release of Major Briggs.

150
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:52,683
But then, you'll have plenty of time
to reflect upon that, won't you?

151
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:57,546
Goodbye, Leo.

152
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,850
And good luck.

153
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:48,935
One and two and three, step four.

154
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,441
And one and two--
Let the mood carry you.

155
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,977
Don't be afraid of your vulnerability.
Show me more leg.

156
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:58,015
What kind of a dance
is this supposed to be, Mr. Pinkle?

157
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,747
lt's a dance of nature, my friend.

158
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,754
lt's a celebration.
All right, girls.

159
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:08,758
Now, turn around
and bend forward

160
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,624
like a sapling.
A sapling in the wind.

161
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:16,534
That's it. A little bit more, and hold it.

162
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:20,838
What exactly are we celebrating
with us all bending over like this?

163
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:25,341
Don't ever question the vision
of your choreographer!

164
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:28,474
You are but a petal on my rose.

165
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:32,175
Now, please, people.
On the count of one.

166
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:36,447
One and two and three and four.

167
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,055
And one and two

168
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,522
- and three and four...
- l love a chorus line.

169
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,722
lf we could just focus here
for a second.

170
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,795
l've gotta get back to the diner.

171
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:50,629
Now, what qualities do we think
best exemplify Miss Twin Peaks?

172
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,907
Beauty and power.

173
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,905
That's the way l like them.

174
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:01,206
Poise and, God help us,
a sophistication

175
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,405
and breeding.

176
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,848
Well, l think a major factor
should be originality.

177
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,044
Well, wouldn't that fall under talent?

178
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,417
lt's always nice when it does.

179
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:15,550
Personally,
l've always been big on style.

180
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,524
l think this is enough
for me to work with,

181
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,757
so l'm gonna go back
and work up the scoresheets,

182
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,901
and l'll see you tonight.

183
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,865
- Terrific.
- Bye.

184
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,732
And three and four.

185
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,106
Okay, that's a break, team.

186
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,369
Hi, Dick. We're on break.

187
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,171
Hi, Lana.

188
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,414
Would you mind helping me
find something in the storage room?

189
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:40,745
Storage room?

190
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,787
We're missing
a very important prop.

191
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,547
Come on.

192
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,235
l'm having trouble.

193
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,602
Well, just flick it.

194
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:09,413
Now, what exactly
did you need to find?

195
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:15,915
- Lana?
- Oh, did l do that?

196
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:18,917
What are you looking for?

197
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:24,085
Well, now, l don't know
the exact technical name for it, but...

198
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:30,899
Does anything--?
Does anything in here look like it?

199
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:36,169
Oh, l think this might be it.

200
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:41,302
Oh, by George, l think you've got it.

201
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:54,590
Diane, it's 1 :1 7 p.m.
l have just concluded

202
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,751
my second meditation of the day
in lieu of sleep.

203
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,194
And l feel completely refreshed
and struck again by the realization

204
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,527
that all of us on this great big
planet Earth

205
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,761
live at only a fraction
of our potential.

206
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,800
We are working round the clock
on the cave petroglyph.

207
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:12,273
l am certain that the answers lie
in this mysterious etching.

208
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,037
l am also convinced
that Windom Earle

209
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:16,340
is searching for exactly
the same thing as we are

210
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,710
for diametrically opposite reasons.

211
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:22,320
lf l'm correct in my assumptions
about the power of this unholy place,

212
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:25,150
God help us if he gets there first.

213
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,291
Diane, at this particular juncture,

214
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,157
l would like to make specific mention
of Annie Blackburn.

215
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,890
She is a completely original
human being.

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,627
Her responses,
as pure as those of a child.

217
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:41,034
l must be honest, l haven't felt this way
about a woman since Caroline.

218
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,505
lt has taken meeting Annie
for me to realize

219
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,338
how gray my life has been
since Caroline's death.

220
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,709
How cold and solitary.

221
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,480
Although occasionally,

222
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,744
there is something to be said
for solitude.

223
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:05,760
Annie Blackburn,
you have almost perfect timing.

224
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,695
That's not
what our choreographer says.

225
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,164
What can l do for you?

226
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:15,330
Well, l need to give a speech
in six hours.

227
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,032
l haven't written a word,

228
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,575
and l don't have any idea
what l wanna say.

229
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,337
l'm in a complete
sweaty-palmed panic,

230
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,278
and l need to talk to someone,
namely you.

231
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,747
What's your topic?

232
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,352
What you can do
to save our local forests.

233
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,513
l just don't wanna stand up there
like some deranged Barbie doll,

234
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,454
saying things like,
''Make sure your campfires are out,

235
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,218
kind of like my brain.''

236
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:39,694
- You're terrified of public speaking.
- Yes.

237
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:42,766
All right, well...

238
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:47,029
...our forests need saving because
of the way people regard them.

239
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:48,937
Expendable.

240
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,469
lf the Ghostwood development
cost thousands of lives,

241
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:54,544
do you think it would have
a chance of going forward?

242
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,411
Well, trees aren't the same
as people.

243
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,574
But they are alive.

244
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:04,583
Your forest is beautiful
and peaceful.

245
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,093
Part of it's been damaged.

246
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:11,726
l've tried to replant,
but nothing's taken root.

247
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,332
Every forest has its shadow.

248
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:19,928
l can see half my life's history
in your face,

249
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,403
and l'm not sure that l want to.

250
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,583
l don't wanna talk about trees
anymore.

251
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,123
All l know is,
l wanna make love with you.

252
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:14,123
And this is me with last year's
regional champion from Yakima.

253
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,692
He was cute, but a little slow. Next.

254
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:22,866
Oh, and this is me
with Brock Farmington,

255
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,530
triple-A champion from Spokane.

256
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,069
Superior upper-body strength,

257
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:32,540
and quads like bridge supports.

258
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:36,706
l pinned him in a minute five.

259
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,406
Next.

260
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:44,679
Oh, this is me
with all the stuff l won.

261
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,587
- That's nice.
- Way to go.

262
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,921
Thank you, Nadine.

263
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,588
Well, now,

264
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,702
l suppose all of you are wondering
just why we've gathered here today.

265
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:04,537
See, l learned that when a couple
is contemplating div--

266
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,401
Breaking up,

267
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:11,915
well, sometimes it's easier
to talk about our feelings

268
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:13,880
when we're around other people.

269
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:19,582
So, Nadine,
maybe you'd like to begin.

270
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,822
Okay.

271
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,425
Well, l guess it all started

272
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:28,727
when l noticed Mike's buns
in the hall at school.

273
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:30,959
Yes.

274
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:34,065
Well, how are you feeling now?

275
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,972
Well, a little guilty, l guess.

276
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:45,549
l mean, Mike and l are hot.

277
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,709
And Miss Twin Peaks is tonight,

278
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:52,084
and Mr. Pinkle thinks
l'm a show-business natural.

279
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:57,486
Well, l mean, because l'm so happy,

280
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,893
l worry about Ed being sad.

281
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:06,769
Ed, is there something
that you'd like to tell Nadine?

282
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,074
Nadine...

283
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:15,580
...Norma and l
plan on getting married.

284
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,282
Really?

285
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:26,320
Well, that's wonderful, Eddie,

286
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:29,791
because Mike and me
are getting married too.

287
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,808
Which way is the castle?

288
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,093
- l waited for you.
- Thanks, Harry.

289
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,204
Not that he's too talkative.

290
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:50,864
He checks out okay physically.
Doc ran some blood tests.

291
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:53,768
He's been shot full of haloperidol.

292
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,111
Right.

293
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,379
Garland?

294
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:02,019
Did Windom Earle do this to you?

295
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:03,984
Garland?

296
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,048
Odd name.

297
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:09,856
Judy Garland?

298
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,022
Was it Windom Earle?

299
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,495
lt was God, l suppose.

300
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:21,567
Garland, where did he take you?

301
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:23,302
The woods?

302
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:25,640
Can you be more specific?

303
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,206
They were lovely.

304
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:35,817
Dark. The king of Romania
was unable to attend.

305
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,252
Harry, this is gonna take some time.

306
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,626
- How much time we got?
- Not enough.

307
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,167
Let's leave him here with us.
Maybe something will bubble up.

308
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,165
Harry, we're in trouble.

309
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:59,242
lf the door to the Black Lodge
does exist,

310
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,675
it probably exists at a point in time.

311
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,347
Now, an object, such as a door,

312
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:05,983
normally exists at a point
in time and space.

313
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:07,679
By way of contrast,

314
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,253
a shooting star normally exists
at a point in time

315
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,855
over a continuum of space.

316
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:15,288
But taken from the star's point of view,
it's a completely different experience.

317
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,791
You just lost me.

318
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:20,193
lf we're not at the right place
at exactly the right time,

319
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,356
we won't find our way in.

320
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,433
Sheriff?

321
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,605
Could the Four-H Club
have anything to do with all of this?

322
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,931
Doubtful, Andy.

323
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,338
This has to be the last box.
Look at it.

324
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,450
l can't take any more of this.

325
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,878
Boxes inside boxes.

326
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,385
Whatever is in that
better be worth a fortune.

327
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,020
Maybe it's not a box at all.

328
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:50,589
Maybe it's just a block
of stainless steel.

329
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:54,027
- Eckhardt's last little joke.
- lt'd be a good one.

330
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:58,469
Let's channel
some of that high wit into the job.

331
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:00,466
Again.

332
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:03,470
l can't believe a little crumb like that

333
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:07,475
can stand up to
this Cram Jack all-duty vise.

334
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,140
On three. One, two and three!

335
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,914
l'm sorry, Andrew.
That was my fault.

336
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,763
Dumb boxes!

337
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,064
Andrew!

338
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,241
Darn boxes.

339
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:54,954
Nice shooting, Andrew.

340
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,526
Look at that.

341
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,390
A key!

342
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:08,239
And where there's a key,
there's a lock.

343
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,367
lt should be kept safe.

344
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:15,804
Yes, in plain sight.

345
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:20,116
You two don't trust each other?

346
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,951
Of course we do.

347
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:26,215
Like brother, like sister.

348
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:30,194
How about here?

349
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,993
ln the cake saver.

350
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,997
ln plain sight.

351
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:42,401
- So we have a key.
- Yes, we do.

352
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,253
You look truly beautiful.

353
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:58,280
Read us your speech.

354
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,287
l'd rather talk about the truth
right now.

355
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,529
What truth is that?

356
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,431
l know something's going on
with you and Benjamin Horne,

357
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,828
and l wanna know what it is.

358
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,329
Donna,
don't talk to your mother like that.

359
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:16,132
You know, l'm really tired of you
talking to me like l'm a child.

360
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,936
l wanna know what's going on.

361
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,177
Donna, l understand your feeling.

362
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,646
But there are some things
you just have to trust.

363
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:28,547
You're young
and you don't know all the limitations.

364
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,449
l know the limitations of lying.

365
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,453
l know that you raised me
to tell the truth.

366
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:35,386
l expect the same from you.

367
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:39,863
lf you're not gonna tell me
what l need to know,

368
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,499
l'll find out from Benjamin Horne.

369
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,827
- No.
- Then tell me.

370
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:53,209
All right, this is your choice,
not mine.

371
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,309
Donna.

372
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:58,410
Donna!

373
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,833
By heavens.

374
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:19,869
Andy, take a look at this.

375
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:21,699
What you mistook
for the Four-H Club,

376
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:24,603
the four and the H,
are actually astrological symbols.

377
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,506
- You mean, like planets?
- Why, yes, Andy.

378
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,408
They stand for Jupiter and Saturn.

379
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,412
Some of the others
represent planets as well,

380
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:35,451
but this particular part of the puzzle
pertains to a precise planetary position.

381
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,919
- Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.
- What's that supposed to mean?

382
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:42,349
Well, historically, Harry,
when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct,

383
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:45,257
there are enormous shifts
in power and fortune.

384
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,261
Jupiter being expansive
in its influence,

385
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:48,728
Saturn, contractive.

386
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,893
Conjunction suggests a state
of intensification, concentration.

387
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:56,268
What this indicates to me
is the potential for explosive change,

388
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:59,069
- good and bad.
- So when's the next conjunction?

389
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:01,535
Well, now, let's see.

390
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,772
According to the ephemeris...

391
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,342
...the next conjunction is due
January to June.

392
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:11,788
My God, Harry.

393
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:13,288
The door to the Lodge.

394
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,359
That's when it's open.
That's what the puzzle is telling us.

395
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,930
lt's telling us
when it's gonna be open.

396
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:22,123
Protect the queen.

397
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,134
lf it's telling us when,
then it must also tell us where.

398
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:31,172
Fear and love open the doors.

399
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,775
What's he saying?

400
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:38,678
He said,
''Fear and love open the doors.''

401
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:42,779
Two doors, two lodges.

402
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,785
Fear opens one, the black.

403
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,981
- Love, the other.
- What's that mean?

404
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,024
l don't know exactly.
lt just came to me.

405
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:52,424
How does the queen--?

406
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,595
- Of course, the queen.
- Of Romania?

407
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,827
No. The chess game's final piece.
Harry, follow my logic.

408
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:02,167
- lf Windom Earle takes the queen--
- Game's not over till he takes the king.

409
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,831
That depends. Maybe he takes her
to the doorway when it opens.

410
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,102
- Which queen are we talking about?
- Agent Cooper.

411
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:08,438
Just a minute, Andy.

412
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:11,881
The queen. The queen.
The crown. The queen.

413
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,018
- Harry, the queen.
- Agent Cooper?

414
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,481
Andy, please.

415
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:18,851
Harry, Miss Twin Peaks.

416
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:21,788
- Holy smokes, that's it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

417
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,722
Agent Cooper, please.

418
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:28,557
Andy.

419
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:36,197
Coop, the plant's been bugged.

420
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,869
This bonsai isn't from Josie, Harry.

421
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:41,638
This bonsai's from Windom Earle.

422
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:43,976
He's way ahead of us,

423
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,515
and we've been working for him
from the beginning.

424
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,744
- What time does that contest start?
- Any minute.

425
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,512
Let's go.

426
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:54,158
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper!

427
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,635
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

428
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,070
l hope you've had a good weekend.

429
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,937
And welcome
to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,

430
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:57,274
in which one of these lovely
and talented young citizens

431
00:33:57,482 --> 00:34:00,815
will soon be crowned
Miss Twin Peaks.

432
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:04,887
And now, commencing
our talent section of the show,

433
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,785
Lucy Moran.

434
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:27,541
Come on.

435
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:40,388
Small town, man.

436
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,735
So, what,
did you bring your whole family?

437
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,959
We're pulling in deputies from all over
to surround the place.

438
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:50,458
They should be here any time.

439
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:53,791
Harry, it is essential whoever wins
this contest receive 24-hour guard,

440
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,728
house security, l want the works.

441
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,265
As soon as she's announced.

442
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:00,597
Our next entry
is Lana Budding-Milford,

443
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:04,070
who will perform a dance of...

444
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,842
...contortionistic jazz exotica.

445
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,479
- Lana?
- Agent Coop--

446
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:16,071
There, my friend, is a real artist.

447
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:33,523
There is only one way to save a forest,
an idea, or anything of value.

448
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:37,031
And that is by refusing to stand by
and watch it die.

449
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:40,865
There is a law of nature,
which is more fundamental to life

450
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,563
than the laws of man.

451
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:46,436
And when something you care about
is in danger,

452
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,340
you must fight to save it

453
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,075
or lose it forever.

454
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,508
Thank you.

455
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,082
Thank you, Audrey Horne.

456
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:02,022
Now a brief musical interlude.

457
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,453
Thanks, Daddy.

458
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,688
l'm gonna go out there.

459
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:19,339
l wanna know what's going on
with you and my mother.

460
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:21,636
Donna.

461
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,374
l think the wisest course would be,

462
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,453
first of all, just to get together
and talk about this.

463
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:31,917
l don't think so.

464
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:36,654
Donna, l really don't think
this is the time or the place.

465
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:39,385
Old pictures,
Horne bearer bonds in the attic,

466
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,924
love letters to my mom.

467
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,900
l want to tell the truth.
l want to do the right thing.

468
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:48,436
A birth certificate
with no father's name on it.

469
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,403
What the hell's going on here,
Mr. Horne?

470
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,572
Why won't anyone tell me the truth?

471
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:02,810
Donna.

472
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:08,956
Your mother and l...

473
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:15,589
You're my father?

474
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:20,468
Donna.

475
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:22,933
And to illustrate my point,

476
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:25,473
l'd like to quote these words
from Chief Seattle,

477
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,873
leader of the Suquamish tribe:

478
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:31,209
''Your dead are soon forgotten
and never return.

479
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:34,442
Our dead never forget the beautiful
world that gave them being.

480
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,519
They still love its verdant valleys,

481
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:39,782
its murmuring rivers,
its majestic mountains.

482
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:42,687
When the last red man has vanished
from this earth,

483
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:45,828
these forests and shores
will still hold their spirits.''

484
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,957
For the lndians love the earth

485
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,159
as a newborn loves
its mother's heartbeat.

486
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:54,861
Why have we all lost touch
with this beauty?

487
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:58,065
Maybe saving a forest starts
with preserving some of the feelings

488
00:39:58,242 --> 00:40:00,301
that die inside us every day.

489
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:02,571
Those parts of ourselves
that we deny.

490
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:06,148
For if we cannot respect
that interior land,

491
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,513
then neither can we respect
the land we walk.

492
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:12,656
So let us, in walking gently
upon the earth,

493
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,758
leave behind a simple legacy.

494
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:17,256
That we're new warriors,

495
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:20,892
mystic warriors who love the earth

496
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,589
and tried to save it.

497
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,493
Thank you very much.

498
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:36,476
Thanks to all our contestants.

499
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:41,242
Balloting will now commence,
and we will then announce our winner.

500
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:46,690
Have you both forgotten
what day this is?

501
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:49,349
Miss Twin Peaks Day?

502
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,929
Today is the day
my unborn child receives a dad.

503
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:56,191
lt was right on the tip of my tongue.

504
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:58,532
l have decided

505
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:03,970
that regardless of which individual
is biologically responsible,

506
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:07,407
that l want Andy to be the father
of my child.

507
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:09,443
Really?

508
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:14,278
l'm sorry, Dick, but l just have to do
what's best for little what's-his-name.

509
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:16,113
Oh, no, not at all. A sound choice.

510
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,948
Heartiest congratulations,
dearest Andrew.

511
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:23,526
Now, if you'll both excuse me,
l do have a vote to cast myself.

512
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,922
Here's to the children.

513
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,935
Don't sound so disappointed.

514
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,234
My God, Lucy.

515
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:40,571
l'm so honored
you made this decision.

516
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:45,978
And l promise l'll be a great father.

517
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,016
But right now

518
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:53,453
l've got to find Agent Cooper.

519
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:59,460
Men.

520
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,162
lt is time
to make the announcement.

521
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:11,707
The winner of the contest

522
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:14,668
and our new Miss Twin Peaks is...

523
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,144
...Annie Blackburn.

524
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:39,897
Ladies and gentlemen,
your new Miss Twin Peaks!

525
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,147
This is an outrage.

526
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:54,978
She's been living in this town
about 1 5 minutes.

527
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,252
And what the hell got into you?

528
00:42:58,256 --> 00:42:59,689
She gave a beautiful speech.

529
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:01,381
lnherent in her message were words

530
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:04,619
even the most craven of us
can ill afford to ignore.

531
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:24,880
What's happening?

532
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:37,455
Everybody, please,
please stay calm.

533
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,609
Good Lord.

534
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:05,186
This way.

535
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:33,108
Settle down. Everybody settle down.
Don't panic! This way.

536
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:38,017
l will help you.

537
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:48,432
Annie?

538
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,997
Annie?

539
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:56,170
Annie?

540
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:58,104
- Harry.
- What?

541
00:44:58,275 --> 00:44:59,674
- He took Annie.
- What?

542
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:01,436
He got Annie.

543
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,979
Bastard. He won't get half a mile
from here. We'll get him.

544
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,675
Agent Cooper,
l've been looking all over for you.

545
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,952
Andy, they're gonna need you
outside.

546
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,351
This is important.

547
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:16,788
That cave painting in the office,
l finally figured it out.

548
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:20,058
- What?
- l knew l'd seen it someplace before.

549
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:21,891
l know where it's telling us to go.

550
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:23,829
lt's not a puzzle at all.

551
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:26,026
lt's a map.
