1
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,098
Save Shelly.

2
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,033
Save Shelly.

3
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,810
Why, who in the world
let Major Briggs loose, Leo?

4
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:03,847
lt couldn't have been you, could it?

5
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,594
No, no. No punishment, Leo.

6
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,821
lt's too late for that
to do us any harm.

7
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,692
And l have a new game for you.

8
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:36,253
Well, here's our contribution
to the Miss Twin Peaks gala buffet.

9
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,914
And l fully expect to see one of you
up there in the winner's circle.

10
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,620
- Dream on, Norma.
- Don't be so sure.

11
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,855
This is the biggest day of the year
for us.

12
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,624
And we have to have somebody
up there

13
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,392
who really deserves this title.

14
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:50,831
Especially this year.

15
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,399
You mean Laura Palmer?

16
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,234
lt would be a good day for healing.

17
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,937
l think we need more than a day.

18
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:02,547
So, Norma, are they gonna
honor you tonight

19
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,981
on your 20th anniversary
of winning Miss Twin Peaks?

20
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:07,619
Don't remind me.

21
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:10,585
Come on,
if you entered today, you'd win.

22
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,255
Look at you,
you're already working on the judge.

23
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,095
Well, since you mentioned it...

24
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,924
Who are you gonna vote for?

25
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,590
Maybe you could split your vote.

26
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,974
- Hi, Daddy.
- Audrey.

27
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,114
The most intelligent face
that l've seen all day.

28
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:42,780
You make the rest of us
look like primates.

29
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,453
What's with all the books?

30
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,619
Yes, the Koran,

31
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,690
the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud,

32
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,957
the Bible, Old and New Testaments,

33
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,995
the Tao Te Ching.

34
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,801
Audrey, l hold in my hands
those holy books

35
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,136
which constitute
the fundamental framework

36
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,801
of humanity's
philosophy of good.

37
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,383
Somewhere in here
are the answers that l seek.

38
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:17,217
And l intend to read them
from cover to cover, until l find...

39
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,487
Listen to me prattling on.

40
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,424
lt's Jack, isn't it?

41
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,161
lt's only been a day.

42
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,662
l hope it doesn't hurt this much
in a week.

43
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,210
Honey, may l give you
a piece of ageless wisdom

44
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,473
culled from these volumes?

45
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,980
Time heals all wounds.

46
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:49,386
l know how it feels.

47
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,353
Believe me.

48
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:55,989
We barely had time
to know each other.

49
00:06:56,596 --> 00:07:01,033
But the time that you had
was highly concentrated.

50
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:06,270
lt's the concentrate
they make concentrate from.

51
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:12,039
l'm afraid l'll never see him again.

52
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,871
Jack is a man of his word.

53
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:19,382
And if he said that he'd be back,
then he will be back.

54
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:22,112
l promise you.

55
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:26,622
Daddy, you can't promise me,
but thanks for wanting to.

56
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:31,094
l actually came here
to update you on my trip to Seattle.

57
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,794
Right. Update away.

58
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,066
Okay.

59
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,933
The Packards are using
Twin Peaks Savings and Loan

60
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,404
to funnel cash
to the Ghostwood project.

61
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:45,874
But the bank is keeping
a very low profile.

62
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,378
lt seems they don't want
any bad publicity.

63
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,944
Oh, they don't?

64
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,878
Well, bad publicity
is exactly what they're gonna get.

65
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,516
Audrey, have you given
any more thought

66
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,752
to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant?

67
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,065
Daddy...

68
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,429
From the bottom of my heart,

69
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,970
l don't wanna be
the town bathing beauty.

70
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,164
l understand.

71
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:20,569
But Miss Twin Peaks
is the ultimate local forum.

72
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,808
Audrey.

73
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:27,847
lt would truly be inspirational

74
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:31,182
to have a winner
with a political sensibility

75
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,688
that extends
beyond makeup strategies

76
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,763
and recipes for cherry pie, huh?

77
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,991
Now, as you know,

78
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,967
each contestant gives a speech
to the assembled town.

79
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:49,006
This year's theme concerns
our immediate environment.

80
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,770
And what we must do to preserve it.

81
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:56,143
l know there's another way to do this,
Daddy.

82
00:08:56,316 --> 00:09:00,116
Audrey, make the speech.

83
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:03,346
Help stop Ghostwood.

84
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:07,391
And take us to a better day.

85
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,492
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?

86
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,499
Not today.

87
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,199
And before you ask,

88
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,864
we still got people out
combing the woods for Major Briggs.

89
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:26,305
Harry, considering our mutual
connection to Project Blue Book,

90
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,572
l believe that Windom Earle
has targeted the major.

91
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,717
- What for?
- lnteresting.

92
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,348
l don't know.

93
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:40,559
But with your permission,
l'd like to speak out loud.

94
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:43,722
Windom Earle has been
seeking access to the Black Lodge

95
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,990
as far back as 1 965.

96
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:47,763
This chess game may involve

97
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,162
more pieces
than we've begun to imagine.

98
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,395
Then of course,
there's the mysterious circumstances

99
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,130
surrounding Josie's death
to consider.

100
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,738
What about them?
Consider them how?

101
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,107
When she died-- l'm sorry
l didn't mention this before, Harry,

102
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,272
but l had to take into account
your mental state.

103
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,574
What is it?

104
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,683
She was trembling with fear.

105
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,154
l would go as far as to say
quaking like an animal.

106
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,752
l might venture a guess to say
that it was the fear that killed her.

107
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,453
At the moment of her death...

108
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,959
...l saw Bob.

109
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,295
As if he had slipped in
through some crevice in time.

110
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,370
Upon reflection, l believe
there's a connection

111
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,302
between his appearance
and Josie's fear.

112
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,873
As if he was attracted to it.

113
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,608
Feeding off it somehow.

114
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,537
You see a connection
between Bob and the Black Lodge?

115
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,983
Harry,
l think it's where he comes from.

116
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:43,212
l think that the Black Lodge
is what you have referred to in the past

117
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,119
as ''the evil in these woods.''

118
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,556
lf Windom Earle is seeking access
to that,

119
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,891
it is imperative that we find our way in
before he does.

120
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,430
There's a source of great power there,
Harry.

121
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:58,635
Far beyond our ability
to comprehend.

122
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,773
Eureka!

123
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:08,208
Dale, l could kiss
your pointy little head.

124
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,250
lt's fear.

125
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,511
lt's fear, Leo. That's the key.

126
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,417
My favorite emotional state.

127
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,356
And all this time,
it's been staring me right in the kisser.

128
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:25,293
Leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit.

129
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,093
These night creatures that hover
on the edge of our nightmares

130
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:31,498
are drawn to us
when we radiate fear.

131
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,434
lt's their bread and butter.

132
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,597
A perfect symbiosis.

133
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,802
Oh, nature,
perfect in design and aspects.

134
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,379
You do not disappoint!

135
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,675
Leo, look lively.

136
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:47,447
Victory is at hand.

137
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,454
We know where the entrance is.
We know when the lock appears.

138
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:56,755
Now we hold the key in our hands.

139
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:02,490
Forgive my hasty departure,
dear one.

140
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:07,401
The time has come
to gather my beloved queen

141
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:10,906
and embark
upon our dark honeymoon.

142
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,808
l haven't been this excited
since l punctured Caroline's aorta.

143
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:22,821
Leo, we must share
a final sentiment.

144
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:26,356
During our time together
in this verdant bower,

145
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:31,395
l must confess, l've developed
something of a fondness for you.

146
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:35,591
Sounding board, companion,

147
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,828
ever obedient and faithful.

148
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:42,099
An overall A for effort, Leo.

149
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:46,404
But l'm still a trifle miffed
at your release of Major Briggs.

150
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:52,683
But then, you'll have plenty of time
to reflect upon that, won't you?

151
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:57,546
Goodbye, Leo.

152
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,850
And good luck.

153
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:48,935
One and two and three, step four.

154
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,441
And one and two--
Let the mood carry you.

155
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,977
Don't be afraid of your vulnerability.
Show me more leg.

156
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:58,015
What kind of a dance
is this supposed to be, Mr. Pinkle?

157
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,747
lt's a dance of nature, my friend.

158
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,754
lt's a celebration.
All right, girls.

159
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:08,758
Now, turn around
and bend forward

160
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,624
like a sapling.
A sapling in the wind.

161
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:16,534
That's it. A little bit more, and hold it.

162
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:20,838
What exactly are we celebrating
with us all bending over like this?

163
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:25,341
Don't ever question the vision
of your choreographer!

164
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:28,474
You are but a petal on my rose.

165
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:32,175
Now, please, people.
On the count of one.

166
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:36,447
One and two and three and four.

167
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,055
And one and two

168
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,522
- and three and four...
- l love a chorus line.

169
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,722
lf we could just focus here
for a second.

170
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,795
l've gotta get back to the diner.

171
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:50,629
Now, what qualities do we think
best exemplify Miss Twin Peaks?

172
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,907
Beauty and power.

173
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,905
That's the way l like them.

174
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:01,206
Poise and, God help us,
a sophistication

175
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,405
and breeding.

176
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,848
Well, l think a major factor
should be originality.

177
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,044
Well, wouldn't that fall under talent?

178
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,417
lt's always nice when it does.

179
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:15,550
Personally,
l've always been big on style.

180
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,524
l think this is enough
for me to work with,

181
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,757
so l'm gonna go back
and work up the scoresheets,

182
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,901
and l'll see you tonight.

183
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,865
- Terrific.
- Bye.

184
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,732
And three and four.

185
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,106
Okay, that's a break, team.

186
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,369
Hi, Dick. We're on break.

187
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,171
Hi, Lana.

188
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,414
Would you mind helping me
find something in the storage room?

189
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:40,745
Storage room?

190
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,787
We're missing
a very important prop.
