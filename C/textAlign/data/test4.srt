1
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,631
Murder.

2
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,608
Mystery.

3
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,734
The macabre.

4
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:43,314
What is it about a heart-boiled
detective femme fertile,

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,906
and the cold steel of a gun,

6
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:50,169
keeps our bedside lamps burning
into the wee hours of the morning.

7
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:52,846
However the spell is cast,

8
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,939
tonight we honor a master of the form

9
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:59,424
and celebrate the launch
of storm fall.

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,903
Call me when you're ready
to wash that off.

11
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:08,480
The stunning conclusion to his best selling
derek storm mystery series.

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,203
Ladies and gentlemen

13
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,554
The master of the macabre,

14
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,329
Rick Castle.

Who are you?

18
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,700
Alison tisdale--

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,490
24, grad student at n.Y.U.,

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,238
Part of the social work program.

21
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:58,899
Nice place for a social worker.

22
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,203
Daddy's money.

23
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,194
Neighbors called to complain about the muc.

24
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:04,298
When she didn't answer,
they had the super check on her.

25
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:06,359
No signs of struggle.

26
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:09,935
He knew her.

27
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:11,451
Even bought her flowers.

28
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,286
Who says romance is dead?

29
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,314
I do, every saturday night.

30
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:16,899
A little lipstick wouldn't hurt.

31
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,162
I'm just saying.

32
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:21,051
So what'd he give her besides roses?

33
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,615
Two shots to the chest,

34
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:25,870
Small caliber.

35
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,889
Does this look familiar to anyone?

36
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,570
No, but i'm not the one with
a thing for freaky ones.

37
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,581
Just give me a "jack shot jill over bill"

38
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,228
So i can get my collar and go home.

39
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,554
Oh, but the freaky ones require more.

40
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,107
They reveal more.

41
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:49,001
Look at how he left her, covered modestly.

42
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,034
So?

43
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,808
So despite all of the effort,
all of the preparation,

44
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:55,090
You won't find any evidence of sexual abuse.

45
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,982
You really get that from just this?

46
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,410
This, plus, i've seen this before.

47
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,737
You've seen it before? Where?

48
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:04,795
Roses on her body, sunflowers on her eyes?

49
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,361
Don't you guys read?

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,186
What kind of idiot
Kills off his best-Selling main character?

51
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:17,507
Are you asking as my bloodsucking publisher

52
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,278
Or as my bloodsucking ex-Wife?

53
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,687
Oh, is that what you're doing?

54
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,529
Punishg me by killing the golden goose?

55
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,626
Oh, come on. I may be petty and shortsighted,

56
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,187
But i'm not that petty and shortsighted.

57
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,609
Really? Then why?

58
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,591
Writing derrick used to be fun.

59
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,726
Now it's like work.

60
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,409
Mm. God forbid you should work.

61
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,594
I mean, you could have retired him,

62
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:34,542
You could have crippled him.

63
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,618
You could have had him join the friggin' circus.

64
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,918
But, no, you had to put a bullet through his head.

65
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,922
Yeah, real messy, too. Big exit wound.

66
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,024
Don't worry. Derrick storm is not
the golden goose here. I am.

67
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,075
I wrote half a dozen best
sellers before him.

68
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,559
What makes you think i'm gonna stop now?

69
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,342
Oh, i don't know.
The fact the new book was due nine weeks ago?

70
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:54,508
You can't rush genius.
