1
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,631
Murder.

2
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,608
Mystery.

3
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,734
The macabre.

4
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:43,314
What is it about a heart-boiled
detective femme fertile,

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,906
and the cold steel of a gun,

6
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:50,169
keeps our bedside lamps burning
into the wee hours of the morning.

7
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:52,846
However the spell is cast,

8
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,939
tonight we honor a master of the form

9
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:59,424
and celebrate the launch
of storm fall.

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,903
Call me when you're ready
to wash that off.

11
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:08,480
The stunning conclusion to his best selling
derek storm mystery series.

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,203
Ladies and gentlemen

13
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,554
The master of the macabre,

14
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,329
Rick Castle.

Who are you?

18
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,700
Alison tisdale--

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,490
24, grad student at n.Y.U.,

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,238
Part of the social work program.

21
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:58,899
Nice place for a social worker.

22
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,203
Daddy's money.

23
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,194
Neighbors called to complain about the muc.

24
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:04,298
When she didn't answer,
they had the super check on her.

25
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:06,359
No signs of struggle.

26
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:09,935
He knew her.

27
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:11,451
Even bought her flowers.

28
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,286
Who says romance is dead?

29
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,314
I do, every saturday night.

30
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:16,899
A little lipstick wouldn't hurt.

31
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,162
I'm just saying.

32
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:21,051
So what'd he give her besides roses?

33
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,615
Two shots to the chest,

34
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:25,870
Small caliber.

35
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,889
Does this look familiar to anyone?

36
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,570
No, but i'm not the one with
a thing for freaky ones.

37
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,581
Just give me a "jack shot jill over bill"

38
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,228
So i can get my collar and go home.

39
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,554
Oh, but the freaky ones require more.

40
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,107
They reveal more.

41
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:49,001
Look at how he left her, covered modestly.

42
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,034
So?

43
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,808
So despite all of the effort,
all of the preparation,

44
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:55,090
You won't find any evidence of sexual abuse.

45
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,982
You really get that from just this?

46
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,410
This, plus, i've seen this before.

47
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,737
You've seen it before? Where?

48
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:04,795
Roses on her body, sunflowers on her eyes?

49
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,361
Don't you guys read?

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,186
What kind of idiot
Kills off his best-Selling main character?

51
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:17,507
Are you asking as my bloodsucking publisher

52
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,278
Or as my bloodsucking ex-Wife?

53
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,687
Oh, is that what you're doing?

54
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,529
Punishg me by killing the golden goose?

55
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,626
Oh, come on. I may be petty and shortsighted,

56
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,187
But i'm not that petty and shortsighted.

57
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,609
Really? Then why?

58
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,591
Writing derrick used to be fun.

59
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,726
Now it's like work.

60
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,409
Mm. God forbid you should work.

61
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,594
I mean, you could have retired him,

62
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:34,542
You could have crippled him.

63
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,618
You could have had him join the friggin' circus.

64
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,918
But, no, you had to put a bullet through his head.

65
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,922
Yeah, real messy, too. Big exit wound.

66
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,024
Don't worry. Derrick storm is not
the golden goose here. I am.

67
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,075
I wrote half a dozen best
sellers before him.

68
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,559
What makes you think i'm gonna stop now?

69
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,342
Oh, i don't know.
The fact the new book was due nine weeks ago?

70
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:54,508
You can't rush genius.

71
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:57,016
Genius, richard? Try blockage.

72
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,974
I heard you haven't written in months.

73
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:00,972
That's ridiculous.

74
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:02,634
My sources are very reliable.

75
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:03,359
Well, they're wrong.

76
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,370
They better be.

77
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,506
If i don't have a new muscript
On my desk in the next three weeks,

78
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:10,390
Black pawn is prepared to demand
the return of your advance.

79
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,451
You wouldn't dare.

80
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,211
Try me. Just try me.

81
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,349
You know, i already returned that advance.

82
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,443
I spent it divorcing you.

83
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:26,547
Really, dollface,
who does homework at a party?

84
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:27,729
I have a test next week.

85
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,162
So do i--Liver function.
You don't see me studying.

86
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,298
All right, give me a hit of the bubbly.

87
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,052
Make that two.

88
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,272
Hey, kiddo. Sales must be slipping.

89
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,109
They're only serving the soft stuff.

90
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,039
Hey, dad.

91
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,991
Hey, sweetie. So, mother...

92
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,795
Shh! Shh! Shh! Not so loud.
I'm still hoping to get lucky.

93
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,489
Did you tell gina i was having trouble writing?

94
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,815
Oh, i told her nothing of the sort. I...

95
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,847
I may have said something
About spending your days

96
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:58,490
moping in your underwear
Waiting for post time at belmont.

97
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,062
But hey, you're an artist.
It's expected.

98
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:02,010
We had aeal.

99
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,230
I let you live with us,
but you don't talk about my work.

100
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,808
What's to talk about?
You haven't done any

101
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:06,850
-  since i moved in.
- Gram.

102
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,479
- Well, he hasn't.
- Whatever i have and haven't done,

103
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,237
I would just appreciate it if you wouldn't share it
With my ex-Wife.

104
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:14,820
Oh, what's the big deal?

105
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:17,883
Hang on, sweetie.
I just got a hit on my "graydar."

106
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,362
Bingo! No ring. Stand back, ki.

107
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,795
Mama's going fishing.

108
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,246
You should have me committed.

109
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,039
For what, letting her move in?

110
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,078
I think it's sweet.

111
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,436
Won't be when i strangle her.

112
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:33,759
You know i'm only 15, right?

113
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,796
You're an old soul.

114
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:37,492
Yeah, well, me and my "soul" can wait.

115
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:39,231
When i was your age...

116
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,222
I can't tell that story.

117
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,807
It's wildly inappropriate,
which, oddly, is my point.

118
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,018
Don't you want to have
wildly inappropriate stories

119
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,150
That you can't tell your children?

120
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,834
I think you have enough
of those for the both of us.

121
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,218
Life should be an adventure.

122
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,410
You want to know why i killed derrick?

123
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,035
There were no more surprises.

124
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:57,010
I knew exactly What was going to happen
every moment of every scene.

125
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,199
It's just like these parties.
They've become so predictable.

126
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:03,474
"I'm your biggest fan.
Where do you get your ideas?"

127
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:06,030
And the ever popular
"will you sign my 'chest'?"

128
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,406
That one i don't mind so much.

129
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,371
Yeah, well, f.Y.I., i do.

130
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,243
Just once, i'd like someone to come up to me
And say something new.

131
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,518
Mr. Castle?

132
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:15,543
Where would you like it?

133
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,170
Detective kate beckett, nypd.

134
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,703
We need to ask you a few questions

135
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:21,872
About a murder that took place earlier tonight.

136
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,138
That's new.

137
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,606
<font color="#ffff00">Castle S01e01</font>

138
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,083
Mr. Castle.

139
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,395
You've got quite a rap sheet
for a best-Selling author.

140
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:41,091
Disorderly conduct,

141
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,675
Uh, resisting arrest?

142
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,560
Boys will be boys.

143
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:48,095
It says here that you stole a police horse?

144
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:48,755
Borrowed.

145
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,743
Ah. And you were nude at the time.

146
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:52,646
It was spring.

147
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,078
And every time, the charges were dropped.

148
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,867
What can i say?

149
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,483
The mayor is a fan.

150
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,050
But if it makes you feel any better,

151
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,296
I'd be happy to let you spank me.

152
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,323
Mr. Castle, this whole "bad boy charm" thing
That you've got going

153
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,910
Might work for bimbettes and celebutantes.

154
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,930
Me? I work for a living,

155
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,090
So that makes you one
of two things in my world--

156
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,871
Either the guy who makes my life easier

157
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,190
Or the guy who makes my life harder.

158
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,095
And trust me, you do not want to be
The guy who makes my life harder.

159
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:21,163
Okay.

160
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,390
Alison tisdale,

161
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,510
Daughter of real estate mogul jonathan tisdale.

162
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,843
- She's cute.
- She's dead.

163
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:30,458
Did you ever meet her? Book signing?
Charity event?

164
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,147
It's possible.
She's not in my little black book,

165
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:34,304
If that's what you're asking.

166
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,870
What about this guy?

167
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,999
Marvin fisk, small claims lawyer.

168
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,019
Most of my claims tend
to be on the, um, large side.

169
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,943
So what's this got to do with me?

170
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:48,074
Fisk was found murdered
in his office two weeks ago.

171
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:51,795
I didn't put it together
Until we saw the tisdale crime scene tonight.

172
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,522
"Flowers for your grave."

173
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:56,703
And this is how we found marvin fisk,

174
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,876
Right out of "hell hath no fury."

175
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,782
Looks like i have a fan.

176
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:02,503
Yeah, a really deranged fan.

177
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:04,335
Oh, you don't look deranged to me.

178
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:05,425
What?

179
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:08,043
"Hell hath no fury"--

180
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,795
Angry wiccans out for blood.

181
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,463
Come on. Only hard-Core castle
groupies read that one.

182
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:16,519
Do any of these groupies ever write you letters?

183
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:18,607
Disturbing letters?

184
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,011
Oh, all my fan mail is disturbing.

185
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,264
It's an occupational hazard.

186
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:24,059
Because sometimes in cases like this,
We find that the

187
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,617
- killer attempts to--
- Killer attempts to contact the subject of his obsession.

188
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,274
I'm also pretty well-Versed in
psychopathic methodologies.

189
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:32,582
Another occupational hazard.

190
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,904
And do you know you have gorgeous eyes?

191
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:39,584
So i take it that you won't have any objection
To us going through your mail?

192
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,879
Knock yourself out.

193
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,335
Can i get copies of those?

194
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,302
Copies?

195
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,678
I have this poker game.
It's mostly other writers--

196
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,454
Patterson, cannell-- You know, best-Sellers.

197
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,726
You have no idea how jealous
those would make them.

198
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,938
- Jealous?
- That i have a copycat.

199
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,598
Oh, my gosh.
In my world, that's the red badge of honor.

200
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:57,158
That's the criminal cooperstown.

201
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:00,147
People are dead, mr. Castle.

202
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,974
I'm not asking for the bodies,
just the pictures.

203
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,839
I think we're done here.

204
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:22,682
* i'm just a gal who cain't say no *

205
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:25,739
* i'm in a terrible fix *

206
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:29,511
* i always say, "come on, let's go" *

207
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:31,044
* just when i ought to-- *

208
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,135
Hey, kiddo!

209
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:36,725
I'm just showing burt here
how we did it at the palace.

210
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,962
Does he know it's your theme song?

211
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,338
Ready to bring it home, ducky?

212
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:43,511
Hey! Yes!

213
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,488
Five, six, seven, eight.

214
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:49,625
* i'm just a fool when lights are low... *

215
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,495
You're missing the late show.

216
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,010
I saw it in previews.

217
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,593
Looks like we got a new lead.

218
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,635
His name is burt. He does magic.

219
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:57,558
- Wow.
- Yeah.

220
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:58,982
Let's hope he disappears by morning.

221
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:02,694
C'est apres minuit dans une school night.
Don't you turn into a pumpkin or something?

222
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:04,943
Not when your dad's been
escorted away by cops.

223
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,434
How was the slammer?
Anyone make you their bitch?

224
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:10,703
Sorry, switchblade.
Still belong to you. Baby bird?

225
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:12,263
- I already brushed.
- Your loss.

226
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:18,522
So are you gonna tell me about it
Or do i have to look it up on the fan sites?

227
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:21,083
No, we had a deal.
Surf all the internet you want,

228
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,667
Stay off the fan sites.

229
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,226
Seriously, dad, are
you in some kind of trouble?

230
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:25,994
Despite my best efforts, no.

231
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,922
They want my help on a case.

232
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,066
A case?

233
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:33,768
Apparently, someone's been killing people
The way i kill them in my books.

234
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,749
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

235
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,002
How many?

236
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,642
Two so far.

237
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,377
Are you okay?

238
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:43,704
Yeah. It's just so senseless.

239
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:45,619
Murder usually is.

240
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,662
No, murder usually makes
a great deal of sense--

241
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,619
Passion, greed, politics.

242
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:54,731
What's senseless here
Is the books that the killer chose.

243
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:56,574
"Hell hath no fury,"

244
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,720
"Flowers for your grave"--

245
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,416
My truly lesser works.

246
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,442
Why would a psychotic fan pick those?

247
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,501
Maybe because he's psychotic.

248
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,123
Come on. It's bedtime.

249
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,818
You can figure it out in the morning.

250
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,699
- What are those?
- Castle's greatest hits.

251
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:19,883
You're gonna familiarize yourselves
With all of his murder scenes, so we don't miss any.

252
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,142
Got any on tape?

253
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:24,359
First victim--Male lawyer.

254
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,044
Second victim-- Female social worker.

255
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,482
Somewhere in these books,
those two are connected.

256
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,762
"From the library of katherine beckett."

257
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,330
Do you have a problem with reading, ryan?

258
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,806
Yo, check it, girl. You're totally a fan.

259
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:39,418
Right, of the genre.

260
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,983
Right, the--The genre.
That's why you're blushing.

261
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,044
What are you, 12?

262
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,459
Profiling indicates a perp with low intelligence,

263
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:50,190
Someone who has or thinks he has
A personal relationship with our author.

264
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,202
So that's where we start.

265
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:01,578
What?

266
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,950
I work dead bodies all day.

267
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,747
The last thing i want to do when i go home

268
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,454
Is read murder books.

269
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,947
Aren't you curious?

270
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,529
Curious?

271
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:17,456
About how people can do these
kinds of things to one another.

272
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,762
Whoever did this read castle's books,

273
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:26,002
And somewhere in those pages
Is the answer to where he'll strike next.

274
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:27,217
Okay.

275
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,781
Is all that castle's mail?

276
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:41,035
His fans love him
Almost as much as he loves himself.

277
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,530
Can you take that back to briefing, please?

278
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,574
Did we hear back from the lab?

279
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,726
Yeah, scene was negative
for d.N.A. And prints,

280
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,466
Just like fisk. The guy's careful.

281
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,991
What about tisdale and fisk, any connection?

282
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:55,678
Other than your boy there? No.

283
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:57,953
What's he doing here?

284
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,122
Maybe he likes you.

285
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:00,155
Detective beckett.

286
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,863
Captain?

287
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,021
Yes, sir?

288
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:06,633
Mr. Castle's offered to assist
with the investigation.

289
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,146
Really?

290
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,438
It's the least i can do for the city i love.

291
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,027
Considering the nature of the crime scenes,

292
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:13,186
I think it's a good idea.

293
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:18,404
Sir, can i talk to you for a minute, in private?

294
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:19,566
Nope.

295
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:42,643
What?

296
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:43,578
Nothing.

297
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,127
No, it's just, uh,

298
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,875
The way your brow furrows
when you're thinking--

299
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:49,494
It's cute.

300
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,882
I mean, not if you were playing poker.

301
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,442
Then it'd be deadly. But otherwise...

302
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:53,682
can i ask you a question?

303
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:54,635
Shoot.

304
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:55,975
Why are you here?

305
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:59,421
You don't care about the victims,
So you aren't here for justice.

306
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,928
You don't care that the
guy's aping your books,

307
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,134
So you aren't here 'cause you're outraged.

308
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,866
So what is it, rick?

309
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,463
Are you here to annoy?

310
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,170
I'm here for the story.

311
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,094
The story?

312
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:12,250
Why those people?
Why those murders?

313
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:14,799
Sometimes there is no story.

314
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,214
Sometimes the guy is just a psychopath.

315
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:18,386
There's always a story,

316
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:21,341
Always a chain of events that
makes everything make sense.

317
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:22,635
Take you, for example.

318
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:25,880
Under normal circumstances,
you should not be here.

319
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,422
Most smart, good-Looking women become lawyers, not cops.

320
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:32,895
And yet, here you are. Why?

321
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,835
I don't know, rick.

322
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:37,514
You're the novelist. You tell me.

323
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,047
Well, you're not bridge and tunnel.

324
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,203
No trace of the boroughs when you talk,

325
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,987
So that means manhattan, that means money.

326
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,807
You went to college, probably a pretty good one.

327
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:47,974
You had options.

328
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,011
Yeah, you had lots of options--

329
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:53,446
Better options, more socially acceptable options--

330
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:54,701
And you still chose this.

331
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:58,434
That tells me something happened.

332
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:01,370
Not to you.

333
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,085
No, you're wounded, but you're not that wounded.

334
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,430
No, it was somebody you cared about.

335
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:10,988
It was someone you loved.

336
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,751
And you probably could've lived with that,

337
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:18,003
But the person responsible was never caught.

338
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:26,712
And that, detective beckett, is why you're here.

339
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,887
Cute trick.

340
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:39,690
But don't think you know me.

341
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,827
The point is, there's always a story.

342
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,227
You--You just have to find it.

343
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,010
I think i just did.

344
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,814
Lab's got lifts off the letter.

345
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:06,434
Whose?

346
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:08,918
The system's backlogged.
It'll take a week to run a match.

347
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:09,974
A week?

348
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,755
Welcome to reality, superstar.

349
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,812
Well, never did much like reality.

350
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:14,886
Mayor's office.

351
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,043
Hi, denise. It's rick castle.

352
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,918
- Hi.
- Yeah, is he in?

353
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,138
- Hold on.
- Thanks.

354
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,606
Like i said, the mayor's a fan.

355
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:23,582
Rick!

356
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,947
Yo, big cheese. It's ricky.

357
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,602
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, of course.

358
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,043
- What's up?
- Well, i don't know where you went.

359
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:30,498
We looked all over for you. You took off with that girl.

360
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,618
The man's got the mayor on speed dial.

361
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,010
The rich really are different.

362
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,114
You want himhe's yours.

363
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:37,271
A control freak like you with
something you can't control?

364
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,985
No, no. That's gonna be more
fun than shark week.

365
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:42,516
Okay, you will have your prints in an hour.

366
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:43,451
Mr. Castle?

367
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,882
Half of the guys here are waiting for prints.

368
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,199
You don't just jump the line.

369
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,846
Oh, i think somebody feels threatened.

370
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,518
- I am not threatened.
- No, no, i get it.

371
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:55,719
I can call the mayor, and you can't.

372
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,403
We have procedure, protocol.

373
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:59,954
Yeah, and you always come to
a complete stop at a red light

374
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,934
And you never fudge your taxes.

375
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:04,410
Tell me something. Do you ever have any fun?

376
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,872
You know, let your hair down? Drop your top?

377
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,168
A little "cops gone wild"?

378
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,420
You do know i'm wearing a gun?

379
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,488
Beckett, midtown. They just found another one.

380
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,853
"Death of a prom queen."

381
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:30,103
Maintenance found her an hour ago.

382
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,242
Kendra pitney. She lives in the building.

383
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:36,075
All right. Let's get her out of the water.

384
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,898
Um, you just stay here and don't touch anything.

385
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,683
Hi, i'm richard castle. I'm consulting.

386
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:56,360
Richard castle the author?

387
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,454
On my better days.

388
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:00,991
Lanie parish, medical examiner. I love your books.

389
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,519
You know, you have a real gift with the details of death.

390
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,962
I thought i told you to stay over there.

391
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,433
I got lonely.

392
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:07,983
You got a c.O.D.?

393
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,906
Not until the full exam. But this wasn't a stabbing.

394
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,431
Lack of blood around the wound

395
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,343
Suggests she was dead before it was inserted.

396
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,874
No foam around the mouth, so we know she didn't drown.

397
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,295
Oh, you're good.

398
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,339
Yeah, yeah. She was killed first and then posed,

399
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,362
Just like the others.

400
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,709
Yeah. I know. Cai have a word?

401
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,434
Something wrong?

402
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,915
This is a homicide investigation,
Not a day at disneyland.

403
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,167
If i give you an order,
i expect you to obey it.

404
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,650
Then you don't know me very well.

405
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,697
You know, in my book, the dress was blue.

406
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,178
Stop trying to change the subject.

407
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:39,635
Did tisdale and fisk know each other?

408
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,662
We haven't found a connection. Why?

409
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,627
What about motive?

410
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,586
He's a serial killer. He doesn't need motive.

411
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,149
Beckett. Okay.

412
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,270
They got a match off the print.

413
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:52,778
Kyle cabot--He's in brooklyn. We got him.

414
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:03,360
- Stay here.
- Scout'shonor.

415
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,213
Kyle cabot! Nypd! Open up!

416
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,732
Kyle cabot! Nypd!

417
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,950
Room clear. Room clear.

418
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:33,861
All clear.

419
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:58,145
You should invite him to join your book club.

420
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,691
Beckett! You gotta see this.

421
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,066
Oh, that's creepy.

422
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,443
I was never a scout.

423
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:24,529
Hey, beckett.

424
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,558
Alison's blouse.

425
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,676
I'm guessing he kept trophies.

426
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:33,912
.22 caliber.

427
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:46,687
Show me your hands!

428
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,315
Hands in the air!
Let us see your hands, cabot!
Let me see your hands!

429
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,665
He's still not speaking.

430
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:02,163
State medical records indicate
He's got pervasive developmental disorder.

431
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:04,249
Well, that explains his fixation with me.

432
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,282
P.D.D. Sometimes manifests
In an obsession with a single subject.

433
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,578
Yeah, well, your superfan also has a history of delusions.

434
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:12,014
Guess who his caseworker was.

435
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:13,212
Alison tisdale.

436
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,732
Yeah.

437
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:18,019
Her files indicate that he was on pretty
heavy antipsychotics.

438
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,061
Limited telligence,
Thinks he has a personal relationship with his hero--

439
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:23,062
Looks like your profile was right, detective beckett.

440
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:25,275
So... what, that--That's it?

441
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,377
What more do you want? Evidence is in his apartment,

442
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:29,039
We can connect him with the three victims--

443
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,603
Two from the diner where he worked,

444
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,075
And tisdale was his social worker.

445
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,965
Call the d.A. Get him a legal aid.

446
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,415
- Okay.
- I'm--That's, uh, it's too easy.

447
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:37,946
The reader would never buy it.

448
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,370
This isn't one of your books, castle.

449
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,486
Out here, we find a gustanding over a body with a gun,

450
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:42,878
He's usually the guy who did it.

451
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,581
You know this kid was in and out of the system for years?

452
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,722
Doesn't seem like he ever got the proper treatment

453
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:02,195
Until alison tisdale took over his case file.

454
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,347
She's the one who got him a job at the diner,

455
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,986
And her notes seem to say heas doing okay.

456
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,091
Well, you can let the d.A. Worry about all that now.

457
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,454
Our job is done.

458
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:12,430
Yeah.

459
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,635
Hey, um, can you leave the box? I'll take care of it tomorrow.

460
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:24,690
Castle, i'm kinda glad that you killed off storm.

461
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,082
Less competition.

462
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:27,099
Mm.

463
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:28,698
That's $20 to you, cannell.

464
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:30,506
You're bluffin', patterson.

465
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:33,174
Cough up some of that tv money and you'll find out.

466
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:37,994
Ah, bet's to you, ricky.

467
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,886
Castle?

468
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,399
- Castle!
- Hmm?

469
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,275
- Bet's to you.
- Oh. Sorry.

470
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:47,876
I know that look-- Story trouble.

471
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,707
Yeah, you never should've killed off storm.

472
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:52,018
That was a big mistake. I w-- I would've retired him.

473
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:55,131
Or crippled him. I mean, the man was money.

474
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:57,587
You don't see me Puttin' a bullet through alex cross' head.

475
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:00,731
Yeah, my boy shane scully's gonna be fueling my private jet

476
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,270
Long after people have all forgotten about storm.

477
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,782
Oh, you know what? Just for that, i am gonna call.

478
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,767
So what's the problem, ricky?

479
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:09,971
Maybe we can help.

480
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,291
I'm working on this thing. It starts with a famous author.

481
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,831
Some psycho starts staging murders
Like the way he does in his books.

482
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,863
That's pretty self-Aggrandizing, isn't it?

483
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:21,754
This is castle we're talking about.

484
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:23,851
So... The crime scenes are clean.

485
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,971
Doesn't leave any fingerprints. Doesn't leave any d.N.A.

486
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:29,939
But the psycho writes the author a fan letter
With his prints all over it.

487
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,433
Well, that leads the cops to his apartment,

488
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:33,393
Where they find enough evidence to convict him.

489
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,100
And then?

490
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,907
- That's it.
- That's it?

491
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,219
Yeah. They arrest him.

492
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:44,917
That's terrible. No wonder you're blocked.

493
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,103
And here's another thing--

494
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:48,498
The guy doesn't leave his prints at the scene of the crime,

495
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:50,335
But he sends a letter with his prints on it?

496
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,058
Ahya lost me there.

497
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:53,946
- And what about a twist?
- Yeah. Where's the twist?

498
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:56,870
Yeah, right. Like, uh... like,
maybe somebody set this kid up.

499
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,058
That's what your story needs--

500
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:00,000
The character who thinks the kid's innocent,

501
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,112
Keeps digging until he finds the truth.

502
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,578
Oh, i have just the guy.

503
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,412
What are you doing?

504
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,868
It's a novelist's habit--

505
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,265
Poking through other people's mail,

506
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,774
Checking their medicine cabinets.

507
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:20,277
Why are you still here?

508
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:22,859
I just came by to give you this.

509
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:24,123
It's a little something to...

510
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:27,247
Memorialize our brief partnership.

511
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,771
Don't look so suspicious.

512
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:31,690
Go on. Open it.

513
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,713
I got you an advance copy.

514
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:41,986
I even signed it to you.

515
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,164
Not that you're a fan.

516
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,590
Thanks. That's actually kind of...

517
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:50,978
Sweet.

518
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:58,475
- Well...
- Well...

519
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,518
It was nice to have met you, detective beckett.

520
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:34,074
He didn't.

521
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,215
Oh! He did!

522
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:47,238
Richard castle, you are under arrest
For felony theft and obstruction of justice.

523
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:48,810
You forgot making you look bad.

524
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:50,506
You know, for a minute there,

525
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:53,296
You actually made me believe that you were human.

526
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,522
Cuff him.

527
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:58,119
Ooh! Bondage. My safe word is "apples."

528
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,720
Oh, there's no nd to be gentle.

529
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,019
How'd you find me anyway?

530
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,114
I'm a detective. That's what i do.

531
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:04,923
My mother told you, didn't she?

532
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,286
By the way, the rose petals in the tisdale murder?

533
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:10,395
They're grandiflora, not hybrid teas.

534
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:11,527
I'll make a note of it.

535
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:14,383
Yeah, you probably should
Since it means kyle cabot is innocent.

536
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:20,299
Thank you, officer.

537
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,954
- Hello, father.
- Hello, daughter.

538
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:26,815
I wish i could say i was surprised.

539
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:29,971
It's my fault, really. He never had a father figure.

540
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,874
Oh, that's not true, mother. I had lots of father figures.

541
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:35,275
I see you've met captain montgomery
And detective beckett.

542
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:38,349
And they have agreed to drop the charges
If you agree to behave.

543
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:40,571
No more interference with this case, mr. Castle.

544
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,310
Do we understand each other?

545
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,167
Yeah.

546
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,291
But you still got the wrong guy.

547
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,627
I... really.

548
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:53,290
Darling, must you always
Have to make a comment?

549
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,515
Nah. No, no, no.
Don't tell me that he got to you.

550
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,751
Please. He didn't get to me.

551
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:04,946
She did.

552
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,211
Who--Alison?

553
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:10,090
Marvin fisk, first murder. Kyle knew him from the diner.

554
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,319
And then he kills alison, his social worker.

555
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,894
And then he kills kendra pitney, also from the diner.

556
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:18,162
So?

557
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:20,855
So he starts with a murder of convenience

558
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:24,365
And then escalates to a murder of somebody he knows very well

559
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:27,099
And then goes back to a murder of convenience?

560
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:28,427
It doesn't make any sense.

561
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:30,498
Somebody set up kyle to take the fall.

562
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:33,726
Somebody who knew enough about his fixation with me

563
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,231
To use it to get away with murder.

564
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:37,511
That means we're not looking for a serial killer.

565
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:41,138
We're looking for a good, old-Fashioned murderer--
Someone with motive.

566
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:43,347
You think the victims were somehow related?

567
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,367
Police would've found it by now.

568
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,273
Now if i were writing the story,

569
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:49,825
The killer would've only wanted one of the victims dead.

570
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:52,517
He would've killed the other ones just to cover up the crime.

571
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,806
How do you get away with one murder by committing two more?

572
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,626
At one death, you look for motive.

573
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:58,406
At two, you look for a connection.

574
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:00,503
At three, you look for someone like kyle.

575
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:01,645
At three, you don't need motive,

576
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:05,694
Because mentally unstable serial killers don't usually have one.

577
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:08,270
That makes about as much sense as "mousetrap."

578
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:11,123
I did that play eight times a week for a year.

579
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,578
I still have no idea what it's about.

580
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:17,730
Castle was right.

581
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,575
If he was trying to follow his boo,

582
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,650
Then the roses on alison's body were wrong,

583
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,327
And fisk should've been suffocated by a plastic bag,

584
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,055
Not strangled with a necktie.

585
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,389
And kendra's dress Should've been blue, not yellow.

586
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:31,742
For an obsessive, It would've been impossible
not to get the details right.

587
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,315
Well, if it wasn't him, then who was it?

588
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:37,840
The killer had to have known both his intended victim
And kyle fairly well.

589
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:40,899
The only victim that had any real knowledge

590
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,819
Of kyle's obsessive condition
Would've been alison tisdale.

591
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:48,747
Alison's the key.
She's the one that the killer is trying to hide.

592
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:50,454
Well, as far as we know, she wasn't seeing anyone.

593
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:52,818
And none of her other case profiles fit the profile.

594
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,088
Well, somebody had to know something about her.

595
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:57,367
So if the killer found out about kyle through alison,

596
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,255
Then alison must've been the intended target.

597
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:04,002
Somebody wanted alison dead. We just have to figure out why.

598
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,034
If i have to keep bailing you out,

599
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,975
You're gonna need to raise my allowance...

600
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,999
by a lot.

601
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:11,281
Mine, too.

602
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:22,548
Hi, i'm rick castle.

603
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:24,255
I have an appointment to see mr. Tisdale.

604
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:26,410
=====

605
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,303
===

606
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:28,748
Is he now?

607
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:32,477
This is not what it looks like.
This, uh...

608
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,528
okay, this is exactly what it looks like,

609
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:35,615
But i can explain.

610
00:29:36,002 --> 00:29:37,082
You coming?

611
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,652
Did alison ever mention
Having enemies or being threatened?

612
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:47,258
People loved her.

613
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:49,167
All she wanted was to make the world a better place.

614
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,794
I told all this to the other detective.

615
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,259
I know, sir. We're just following up.

616
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,747
Did alison know anybody who could've profited
From her death?

617
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:59,355
Mr. Castle, i may be rich, but my daughter was not.

618
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:00,831
She abhorred money.

619
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,686
What little she had, she gave to charity.

620
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:04,679
Thank you, sir.

621
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:11,998
Mr. Tisdale, "fortune" magazine estimated your net worth
At nearly $100 million.

622
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:12,931
Is that true?

623
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,334
I don't check day to day.

624
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:16,496
But it's in the ballpark?

625
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:19,759
I've been lucky, yes.

626
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,001
Appreciate your time.

627
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:26,967
Wh-What happens to all that money
If something happens to you?

628
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:27,778
Castle.

629
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:30,282
Half of my estate goes to my charitable foundation,

630
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:31,463
And the rest to my children.

631
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,811
I mean, my son.

632
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:38,727
Thank you.

633
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:51,058
What was that all about?

634
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,070
He's dying.

635
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,412
Who's dying? Tisdale?

636
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,619
You want a hot dog? I want a hot dog.

637
00:30:57,876 --> 00:31:00,514
What do you take on your-- Aah! Apples, apples, apples!

638
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:03,165
- What makes you think he's dying?
- Okay!

639
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,927
- You see those pictures in his office?
- Yeah.

640
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:08,602
He's much thinner now--Like sick thin, not workout thin.

641
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:10,023
His daughter was just murdered.

642
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:12,353
And the way he kept touching his hair, like he's self-Conscious.

643
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:13,150
You think it was a piece?

644
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,961
It's a good one, but it's new to him.

645
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:16,470
The chemo's relatively recent.

646
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,953
And he was wearing makeup.

647
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:19,290
He's trying to look healthier than he is.

648
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,663
Doesn't want his shareholders to know.

649
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:23,239
So he's got cancer. That doesn't mean that he's terminal.

650
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:25,679
But it's a much better story if he is.

651
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,599
You interview the brother?

652
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:29,354
There was never a reason to.

653
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,752
Well, now there is.

654
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,482
- You got hot mustard?
- Yeah.

655
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,112
- Harrison tisdale.
- Yeah.

656
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:42,487
Hey, mitch, let's get these pallets on the truck.

657
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:44,421
Detective kate beckett. Rick castle.

658
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:46,685
We'd like to ask you some questions about your sister.

659
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,964
Yeah, anything i can do. Uh, let's head inside.

660
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:52,280
Last time i saw her? About a month ago at dad's.

661
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:56,598
You know, i... still can't believe she's gone.

662
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:58,106
Were you close?

663
00:31:58,106 --> 00:32:00,886
Ah, everybody loved her. I mean, my sister--

664
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,958
She just wanted to see the best in people,

665
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,807
Even that kid who killed her.

666
00:32:06,146 --> 00:32:08,834
You know, she did everything she could to help that guy.

667
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:12,378
Even brought him around here once
To see if i could get him a job.

668
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:13,643
But you didn't.

669
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,403
I can't afford to, all right?

670
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:17,657
My employees mess up,
I lose my bond.

671
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:21,695
I don't know. Maybe if i'd helped him...

672
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:23,683
Things would be different.

673
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:26,533
How'd your sister react when yourad told you he was dying?

674
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:30,088
She was upset.

675
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:31,239
We both were.

676
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:35,565
Now that she's dead, your inheritance stands to double.

677
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:38,412
What are you suggesting? You already caught the killer.

678
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:42,855
Yeah, we did, but the first thing his lawyers will do
Is shift suspicion to someone else,

679
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:44,110
someone with motive.

680
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,778
And then they'll stick me on the stand
And ask me why i didn't investigate,

681
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,114
And then the jury will have doubts.

682
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:50,166
And we don't want them to have doubts, do we?

683
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,029
No.

684
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,558
So you'll have to excuse me for asking,

685
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:54,426
But where were you the night of your sister's murder?

686
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:57,522
I was traveling... on business.

687
00:32:58,094 --> 00:33:01,915
Actually, i was out of the country
For all three murders.

688
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:06,090
Here. Check the stamps on that if it's useful.

689
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:12,374
A u.S. Passport.

690
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:13,922
Absolutely unassailable.

691
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:15,459
I was sure it was him.

692
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,284
Oh, don't take it so hard.

693
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:20,394
After all, you're just a writer.

694
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:22,127
What?

695
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:22,886
Nothing.

696
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,198
What?

697
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:25,843
Oh, come on.

698
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:27,658
He's lying.

699
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:30,774
I mean, i get him knowing where he was
The night of his sister's murder,

700
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:31,898
But the other two victims?

701
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:34,776
He didn't pause, he didn't ask for dates,

702
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,930
He didn't even check his calendar,

703
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,642
But he was ready with an alibi.

704
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,241
In my experience, innocent people do not prepare alibis.

705
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:44,514
So i was right.

706
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:48,361
Okay, give me the dates and flights.

707
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:50,498
Why can't you just admit i was right?

708
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:53,475
Because he totally fooled you. He totally bought the alibi.

709
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:56,281
I had a fleeting moment of self-Doubt.

710
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:57,319
So?

711
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,994
His credit card company confirms
He paid for three round-Trip tickets.

712
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,554
Dates coincide with the three murders.

713
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:04,090
So according to his credit card, tisdale was out of the country.

714
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,310
Wait a minute. So now i'm not right?

715
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,222
Which means the passport stamps were forged.

716
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:09,577
I'm gonna call passport control and have 'em check their logs.

717
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:11,630
That's, uh, not how he would've done it.

718
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:15,775
You got a better idea, ricky?

719
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,997
Second passport.

720
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,106
And how would he get one of those?

721
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,671
Oh, with his money? Trust me.

722
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,342
On the black market, it would be a piece of cake.

723
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,031
So he leaves the country on his own,

724
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:25,939
Comes back with the other passport, commits murder,

725
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,619
Flies out and then comes back in on his own.

726
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,626
Perfect alibi, perfect murder.

727
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,691
But almost impossible to prove.

728
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:34,074
Unless you find the second passport.

729
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,982
Gotta be freaked after your little meet and greet.

730
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:38,794
Keep eyeballs on him. If he moves, i wanna know.

731
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:42,181
The things that people will do for money.

732
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,569
This guy killed his own sister in cold blood

733
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:46,122
And two more people to cover it up.

734
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,911
He's either a world-Class sociopath,

735
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,038
Or there's a lot more to this story than just money.

736
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:51,655
Judge markway, please.

737
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,419
Oh, markway. Tell him i said hello.

738
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,083
No, seriously. They're redoing the entire back nine.

739
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,076
Oh, man, i loved that course. When are they gonna reopen it?

740
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:05,434
Judge, i hate to break up "golf digest,"

741
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,206
But i have an exigent situation here.

742
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,874
Very well, detective. Play through.

743
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:09,966
We need a search warrant.

744
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,159
She needs a search warrant.

745
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,236
For the home and office of harrison tisdale.

746
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:17,538
Harrison tisdale? As in jonathan tisdale's son?

747
00:35:17,538 --> 00:35:18,910
-  Yes.
- Yep. He murdered his sister

748
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,585
And killed two more people to cover up the crime.

749
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,038
Murder? The tisdales?

750
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,266
You better be long and straight on this one, detective.

751
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,747
Harrison's father is terminally ill, sir.

752
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,859
What? I just saw him at a benefit.

753
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:29,872
Hope you took a picture.

754
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:33,091
With the sister out of the way, the son will inherit all of it.

755
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:34,234
Excuse me.

756
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:37,096
There's also a twisted, emotional angle in there.

757
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:39,303
I don't wa to bore you with the details.
But family and vengeance--

758
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,289
It's shakespearean.

759
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:41,426
Harrison just left work.

760
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:44,174
He's probably headed home to destroy the evidence.

761
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:47,630
Are you sure you can tie him to the other victims?

762
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,846
Through a patient of his sister's
That he was trying to frame.

763
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:54,914
It's days like this
I wish i was back in civil division.

764
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:56,839
Thank you, sir.

765
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:59,303
Thanks. Soon.

766
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:03,766
You're home early, mr. Tisdale.

767
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:21,766
Got a list inside.

768
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:23,101
Yeah, thanks for your help.

769
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,411
What do we got, guys?

770
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,646
Get this. Junior's business is going under.

771
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:34,138
He's tens of millions in debt.

772
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:36,026
But with his sister's share of the tisdale fortune,

773
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,818
He stands to pay off his debt and then some.

774
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:40,581
Castle, if you're going in, you should be armed.

775
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:42,351
My backup's in the glove compartment.

776
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:48,323
I can't find it. It--

777
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:51,466
This time, you're staying put.

778
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,223
Oh, okay, beckett.
Very funny.

779
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:55,895
Joke'sver!

780
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,799
Come on!

781
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,442
Cuff me once, shame on you.

782
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:10,626
Cuff me twice, shame on me.

783
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:23,090
Harrison tisdale? Nypd. We have a warrant.

784
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,058
Just a minute!

785
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,728
Open the door, harrison!

786
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:43,465
Open the door. It's nypd. We have a warrant.

787
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,190
He's coming down the fire escape.

788
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,734
He's out back. Cover the front.

789
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,176
Stop! Police! Don't move!

790
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,680
Castle! No!

791
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,236
I got him! I got him!

792
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,980
Castle!

793
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:49,187
Stay back! Stay back! Don't come anywhere closer!

794
00:38:49,187 --> 00:38:51,851
- Get--Get down! Stay back! Stay back! Don't move!
- Easy, easy!

795
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:52,986
Let him go, harrison!

796
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:55,820
- Come on!
- Easy! Easy! Okay. It's okay. Okay.

797
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,890
Castle! Are you okay?

798
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,474
Yeah, except psycho here needs a breath mint.

799
00:38:59,474 --> 00:39:00,790
- Shut up!
- Okay!

800
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,134
Hey, harrison, you know what's bugging me?

801
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:04,898
If you were that deep in debt,

802
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:07,143
Why didn't you just ask your father for the money?

803
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,944
Castle! You are not helping!

804
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:12,507
You know what i think? I think you did ask.

805
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,951
I think you asked, and he said no.

806
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,103
I think he always said no.

807
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:19,953
Self-Made man like that,
I bet he thought you were weak for asking.

808
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:21,529
He's the one who was weak!

809
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:23,206
I was trying to make something with my life,

810
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:24,859
And all he cared about was her!

811
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:28,886
That's why you killed her. It wasn't just for the money.

812
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:30,993
You wanted to punish him before he died,

813
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,493
Take away the only thing he loved.

814
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:34,355
That's a pretty good story.

815
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,235
Who are you?

816
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:38,111
Harrison, let him go! It's over.

817
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:39,769
It's not over, it's not over!

818
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,667
Drop the gun, or i swear to god, i'll--

819
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:45,360
Tell me you saw that!

820
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:50,011
You're gonna put that in your report, right?

821
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,843
Can i see the cuffs, please?

822
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:53,049
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:57,260
What the hell were you thinking?

824
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,546
You could've gotten yourself killed.

825
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,274
Well, the safety was on the whole time.

826
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:03,715
You know, you could've told me.

827
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:04,908
Where's the fun in that?

828
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:17,855
Well, i guess this is it.

829
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:19,159
Well, it doesn't have to be.

830
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:22,255
We could, uh, go to dinner, debrief each other.

831
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:24,915
Why, castle? Si could be another one of your conquests?

832
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,472
Or i could be one of yours.

833
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:30,582
It was nice to meet you, castle.

834
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,309
It's too bad.

835
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,320
It would've been great.

836
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:42,142
You have no idea.

837
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,635
You wanted to see me, sir?

838
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:21,796
Yeah.

839
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:24,313
I just got a call from the mayor's office.

840
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,992
Apparently, you have a fan.

841
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:27,996
A fan, sir?

842
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:32,087
Rick castle. Seems he's found the main character
For his next set of novels--

843
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:34,422
A tough but savvy female detective.

844
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:37,957
I'm flattered?

845
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:40,539
Don't be. He says he has to do research.

846
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,727
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

847
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:42,751
- No way.
- Beckett, listen--

848
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,593
Sir, he is like a 9 year old on a sugar rush--

849
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:47,159
Totally incapable of taking anything seriously.

850
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,758
But he did help solve this case.

851
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,983
And when the mayor's happy, the commissioner's happy.

852
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:53,452
And when the commissioner's happy, i'm happy.

853
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:54,604
How long, sir?

854
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,623
