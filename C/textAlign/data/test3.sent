INT.
WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN- DAY LEO JOHNSON and MAJOR BRIGGS sit captive against a wall.
Leo slowly looks around the room.
Does so again.
Apparently satisfied, he rises to his feet and moves until the ankle chain snaps him to a halt.
Straining forward, he is able to lean over a table, and takes something from its drawer.
He then returns to beside Briggs, who still looks very dazed, unconscious of his surroundings.
Leo, with great effort, fits his new possession into the lock of Briggs's handcuffs.
Briggs is released.
But does n't realize it.
Leo shakes him.
LEO Save Shelly... Leo is looking up at the wall with Shelly's photo.
Enough internal fog clears for Briggs to realize he is now free.
He gets up unsteadily and stumbles away.
CLOSE ON the wall photos.
2.
SAME PHOTOS- LATER MATCH CUT TO: SOUND of a door closing.
Footsteps.
EXPAND TO show WINDOM EARLE coming in to see Briggs is gone.
EARLE Why, who in the world let Major Briggs loose, Leo?
It could n't have been you, could it?
Leo cringes, expecting another shock.
None comes.
EARLE No, no punishment little Leo.
It's to late for that to do us any harm.
And I have a new game for you.
He holds up a burlap bag.
Something's moving inside.

DINER- DAY Over by the kitchen, SHELLY and ANNIE are sorting silverware, when they're joined by NORMA, who carries over a tray of freshly baked pies.
NORMA Here's our contribution to the Miss Twin Peaks Gala Buffet.
And I fully expect to see one of you up there tonight in the winner's circle.
ANNIE Dream on, Norma.
-LRB- CONTINUED-RRB-# 2.021 3.
CONTINUED: 2.
NORMA Do n't sell yourself short, kid.
This is one of the biggest days of the year for us and we need somebody up there who deserves that title.
Especially this year.
ANNIE... Laura Palmer.
NORMA A day of healing and coming together.
SHELLY We could use more than a day.
-LRB- pause, then-RRB- Norma, is it true they're going to honor you tonight?
Twentieth anniversary of when you won?
Hush.
NORMA-LRB- playful-RRB- SHELLY If you entered you could win today.
NORMA Listen to her, working on the judge already.
SHELLY Since you brought it up... ANNIE Good question: who are you going to vote for?
Ahelly and Annie put an arm around each other and present a united front.
ANNIE Maybe they'll let you split your vote.
NORMA-LRB- laughing-RRB- We have a customer.
ANGLE ON DALE COOPER entering the diner.
It's clear whose customer he is: to Shelly's intrigued glance, Annie walks over toward the counter.
COOPER Looks like a staff meeting of the Double R brain trust.
ANNIE We're trying to decide who's going to win tonight.
-LRB- CONTINUED-RRB-# 2.021 3.

CONTINUED:-LRB- 2-RRB- COOPER No question about it.
You are.
ANNIE You're not exactly objective COOPER I am completely objective.
ANNIE-LRB- softly flirtatious-RRB- I think you're not as objective as you think you are.
COOPER Perhaps that's why it seems so important to me that we kiss.
ANNIE-LRB- affectionate, not shy-RRB- You impetuous boy.
We have an audience.
COOPER I know this violates multiple laws of physics, but at his moment, Annie, and I mean this quite literally... you are the only person in the room.
Annie beams.
They lean across the counter to kiss.
Shelly and Norma look on, smile, look away.

GREAT NORTHERN- DAY CUT TO: AUDREY HORNE stands pensively, her face half-lit by the fireplace glow.
BEN HORNE enters, arms filled with books they nearly obscure him.
Audrey manages a smile.
Hi, Daddy.
AUDREY BEN-LRB- pausing by the fire, nearly losing hold of a tome-RRB- Audrey.
The most intelligent face I've seen all day.
You make the rest of us look like primates.
AUDREY What's with all the books?
-LRB- CONTINUED-RRB-# 2.021 4.
CONTINUED: 4.
BEN-LRB- listing each and every one-RRB- The Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud, the Bible, New and Old Testaments, the Tao-te-ching... I have in my arms those holy books that constitute the fundamental framework of man's philosophies of good.
Somewhere in here are the answers I seek.
I intend to read them, cover to cover until find... Audrey's attention has wandered back to the fire.
Ben Finally stops rambling, sees the sad expression on her face.
BEN Listen to me, prattling on.
It's Jack, is n't it?
AUDREY He's only been gone a day.
I ask myself how much will it hurt next week?
BEN Let me give you a piece of ageless wisdom culled from these volumes: time heals all wounds.
-LRB- she starts to reply-RRB- I know what it feels like.
Believe me, I know.
He'll be back.
AUDREY We barely had time to realize how we felt... BEN But what you had was highly concentrated.
AUDREY It's the concentrate they make concentrate from.
-LRB- sigh-RRB- I'm afraid I'll never see him again.
BEN Jack's a man of his word.
If he said he'll be back, he'll be back, I promise you.
AUDREY-LRB- moved-RRB- You ca n't promise.
But thanks for wanting to.
I actually came in here to update you on my Seattle trip.
BEN-LRB- closes the book-RRB- Update away.
-LRB- CONTINUED-RRB-# 2.021 4.

CONTINUED:-LRB- 2-RRB- AUDREY-LRB- slowly turning her mind to business-RRB- The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan to funnel cash for the Ghostwood Project, but the bank's keeping a very low profile.
They do n't want the bad publicity.
BEN Bad publicity is exactly what they're going to get.
Audrey, have you given any more thought to the Miss Twin Peaks pageant?
AUDREY Daddy, from the bottom of my heart, I do n't want to be the town bathing beauty.
BEN Audrey, Miss Twin Peaks is the ultimate local forum.
It would be truly inspirational to have a winner with a political sensibility that extends beyond makeup strategies and recipes for cherry pie.
-LRB- the Horne twinkle-RRB- And as you know, each contestant makes a speech to the asembled town.
This year's theme concerns our immediate environment.
And what we must do to preserve it.
HOLD ON Audrey for a beat.
Considering brand new strategies.
AUDREY Maybe I'd better take a look through those books myself.

SHERIFF'S STATION- CONFERENCE ROOM CUT TO: START ON the cave painting reproduced on the blackboard: a cluttered concentration of various symbols, stick figures, stars, hieroglyphs.
PULL BACK to ANDY BRENNAN standing myopically close to this drawing, staring at it with his own personal brand of awe.
Cooper and TRUMAN, looking sleepless, re-enter the room carrying their coffees.
COOPER Has he taken his eyes off it yet?
TRUMAN Not today.
-LRB- Andy's beat; moving on-RRB- We've still got people out combing the forest for Major Briggs.
-LRB- CONTINUED-RRB-# 2.021 5.
CONTINUED: COOPER Harry, given their mutual connection to the Blue Book Project, I'm afraid Earle may have targeted the Major.
For what?
Interesting.
TRUMAN ANDY They look over at Andy, who is still completely engrossed in the painting.
Cooper and Truman are in proximity to the bonsai tree.
COOPER I do n't know yet.
All of this appears to be flowing together.
Earle's been seeking access to the Black Lodge as far back as 1965.
This chess game may involve more pieces than we'd begun to imagine.
And then there's the peculiar circumstances of Josie's death to consider.
TRUMAN Consider them how?
COOPER When Josie died... I'm sorry I have n't mentioned this before, Harry, but I had to take into account your mental state What is it?
TRUMAN COOPER She was trembling with fear.
Quaking, like an animal.
I might even venture a guess to say that it was fear that killed her.
And in the moment of her death... I saw Bob.
As if he'd slipped in through a crevice in time.
Upon reflection, I believe there's a connection between his appearance and Josie's fear.
He was attracted by it.
He may even feed off it.
TRUMAN You see any connection between Bob and the Black Lodge?
COOPER I think it's where he comes from.
I believe the Black Lodge is the source of what you've traditionally referred to here as the evil in the woods.
If that's what Earle is seeking, it's imperative that we find our way in before he does.
There's a source of power in that place far beyond our ability to comprehend.

WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN Windom Earle, listening in on his shortwave set, springs out of his chair in excitement.
EARLE Eureka!
Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head.
It's fear!
It's fear, Leo, that's the key!
-LRB- begins packing one of his silver briefcases-RRB- My favorite emotional state and all this time it's been staring me in the kisser.
Leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit.
These night creatures that hover on the edge of our nightmares are drawn to us when we radiate fear, it's their bread and butter, a perfect symbiosis.
And to gain entrance to their realm, a simple offering, the suffering of innocence, Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspect, you do not disappoint.
Leo, look lively, victory is at hand.
We know where the entrance is.
We know when the lock appears and now we hold the key in our hands.
He takes the photos down and packs them, then closes the suitcase.
He lifts the other case.
EARLE Forgive my hasty departure, dear one.
But the time has come to gather my beloved Queen and embark upon our dark honeymoon.
I have n't been this excited since I punctured Caroline's aorta.
-LRB- beat-RRB- Leo, we must share a final sentiment... We still can not see Leo.
EARLE During our time together in this verdant bower, I must confess I've developed something of a fondness for you.
Sounding board, companion.
Ever obedient and faithful.
An all-around`` A'' for effort, Leo.
Though I'm still a trifle miffed at your release of Major Briggs.
But then You'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, wo n't you?
Goodbye, Leo.
And good luck.
As he goes, we PAN DOWN to Leo, who is very tightly shackled.
He is holding the end of a string taut in his mouth.
We FOLLOW the string directly above his head and see that it is holding a large suspended plastic bag shut.
Inside the bag are dozens of deadly spiders.

ROADHOUSE- DAY A line of Miss Twin Peaks contestants in black dance leotards rehearse the opening number.
They include, amongst some faces we do not know, DONNA, Shelly, Annie, LUCY, Audrey, NADINE and LANA.
Standing before them, sleeves up, a cigarette bobbing in his mouth, is the impresario and choreographer, the ubiquitous TIM PINKLE.
The piano player, TRUDY, jumps back into a show tune and the girls begin their chorus line dance.
PINKLE Okay, one and two.
.
and three...-LRB- doing the moves with them-RRB- Step forward one and over and two... The girls continue on their own as Pinkle steps over to a table and takes a large pull off his submarine sandwich.
PINKLE-LRB- through his chewing-RRB- Let the mood carry you... do n't be afraid to be vulnerable... and give me just a little more leg...-LRB- beat-RRB- Now bend forward, like sap in the... er, sapling in the wind... a little further... very good... hold it for me... then up... and out.
The song ends.
Audrey eyes their trainer warily.
PINKLE You girls'll need a lot of work...-LRB- belch-RRB-... but if you stay with it, I think I can make dancers out of you.
-LRB- taking her aside-RRB- Especially you, Miss Horne.
AUDREY What kind of dance was this, Mr. Pinkle?
PINKLE A nature dance, my little friend.
A celebration.
AUDREY What are we celebrating when you have us all bending over?
PINKLE Do n't question the vision of your choreographer.
You're but a petal on the rose.

CONTINUED: DONNA-LRB- aside to Shelly-RRB- Later it'll be the pistils and the stamens.
LUCY Pistils and what?
SHELLY-LRB- ruefully-RRB- Do n't ask.
NADINE We're on stage at last.
That's all that matters.
ANNIE This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.
LANA I think it' t just the greatest thing that ever happened.
PINKLE-LRB- moving back-RRB- Once more with feeling, girls.
I only have three things to say: energy, energy, energy.
ANGLE OFF them over to a booth where the three judges, Norma, TREMAYNE, and Milford sit watching, and discussing.
TREMAYNE If talent's to be any part of our deliberations, we'd best close our eyes until Pinkie's done wrecking havoc.
MILFORD-LRB- entranced-RRB- I love a chorus line.
NORMA-LRB- beat, a look at them both-RRB- If we can focus here for a second, I have to get back to the diner:-LRB- back to the printed agenda of their discussion-RRB-`` What qualities do we think best examplify Miss Twin Peaks?''
MILFORD Beauty and power.
-LRB- drawing their look-RRB- That's how I like'em.
-LRB- CONTINUED-RRB-# 2.021 7.

CONTINUED:-LRB- 2-RRB- TREMAYNE Poise.
And... God help us... sophistication and breeding.
NORMA I think a major factor should be originality.
TREMAYNE Would n't that fall under talent?
MILFORD Always nice when it does.
TREMAYNE.
Personally, I've always been big on style.
NORMA That should be enough to work with.
I'll make up the score sheets this afternoon.
I've really got to go.
Terrific.
TREMAYNE She goes.
Milford eyes Tremayne.
Business time.
MILFORD Score sheets, shmore sheets.
We're set on this, are n't we Dick?
Set on...?
TREMAYNE MILFORD She looks lovely today, does n't she?
TREMAYNE If looks could kill...-LRB- off Milford's hrumph-RRB- Sorry Insensitive of me.
MILFORD She'd make a great Miss Twin Peaks.
TREMAYNE Would n't she just.
But my vote is of course something I hold sacred and will exercise with the greatest care and consideration.
As you well know, being a man who's been charged with the awesome responsibility of running this town.

Lana, as if on cue-LRB- and quite possibly so-RRB-, comes over.
Milford signals her over Tremayne's shoulder.
LANA-LRB- silkenly-RRB- Hello, Dick.
We're on break.
H-hi, Lana.
TREMAYNE LANA Do you think you could help me find something in the storage room?
TREMAYNE The storage room.
LANA We're missing a very important prop..
The Mayor signals his approval to Lana.
