1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,344
Yep. That's
the one I want.

2
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:13,417
I grew 7 inches senior year.

3
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:15,986
Like, I don't know
how tall you are
or whatever.

4
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:19,157
But, like,
man, everything
from here up...

5
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:20,491
It's all new.

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,926
60 percent of all
people meet their
spouses at college.

7
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:25,928
That means my future wife

8
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:28,398
could be, like,
seated right
beside me.

9
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,499
You and a girl.

10
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,100
Yeah, exac...
yeah, why not?

11
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:33,503
Exactly, because,
because, these girls
at college,

12
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,238
they don't know me.
They don't know
who I am.

13
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:39,042
Yeah. They don't know
that you threw up
on the bus in fifth grade.

14
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,177
Exactly.

15
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,512
That you had to have
your finger reattached

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,913
after that wood shop...

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:47,284
The point is, I'm tall
and handsome, and...

18
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,785
And I've gained weight,

19
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,620
and I've, like, finally
got a fashion sense.

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,623
Man, it's like
the beginning
of a whole new era.

21
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,658
A new era?
You're the same guy.

22
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,793
What, you think
you're cool 'cause
you grew like a freak

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,794
and got a haircut?

24
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,629
I'm the same guy.

25
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:01,630
Yeah.

26
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:03,599
Well, uh, I'm the same guy.

27
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:04,866
Well, that's
really interesting.

28
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:05,967
That's really interesting.

29
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,203
I guess old steve

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,904
would have
had no trouble
doing this.

31
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,907
Dude! What the hell
are you doing?

32
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,911
I would have taken that!

33
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:18,380
Oh, god.
What did I do?

34
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,700
Hey, nice fancy haircut.

35
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,135
You should join
those backstreet boys.

36
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,370
Watch out, ladies!

37
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:44,138
I don't look
like a backstreet boy.

38
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:46,274
Listen, you're
going to college, right?

39
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:47,508
You gonna work for me?

40
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:48,509
Right, yes.

41
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,345
You gonna work?
Yes, I'll work.

42
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,346
Say it again.

43
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:52,714
I'm gonna work.
I like your hair.

44
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,515
Thanks.

45
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,951
Not really.
I'm just saying that
because I'm your father.

46
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,676
I think
we're gonna be
on the same floor.

47
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,578
It'll be fun.

48
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:25,512
Go!

49
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,650
Aw, honey, please.
Come here.

50
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,856
Mom, will you just
wake up grandma
and leave already?!

51
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,925
I'm feeling a bit of anxiety.

52
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,460
I mean,
it's not that big
of a deal, but...

53
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,463
no, no.
That's why you need
a resident advisor.

54
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,732
Ok? It, uh, you know...

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,335
Actually, you, you remind me

56
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,270
of a girl we had last year.

57
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,672
You know,
same problems,
everything.

58
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,706
Its...Weird.

59
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,509
But she's doing good?

60
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,279
I think she's
much happier now,
where she is.

61
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,915
Oh, my god!
Is this her?!

62
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:03,916
Who are you?

63
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,652
I'm your roommate
lizzie! Ha ha ha!

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,689
Hi! Oh, my god.
This is gonna
be so much fun.

65
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:12,424
I have bigger
speakers.
I have more
wattage.

66
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,592
I have bigger
speakers.
I have more
wattage!

67
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,795
Wattage
is what matters.
It's the wattage.

68
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:19,664
Amps are completely
meaningless now.
It's wattage.

69
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,998
Hey. How's
it going?

70
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,934
Hey, hey!
Hey!

71
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,168
Hey, you live here?

72
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,670
Uh, yep.
I think so.

73
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,839
I told you.
I told you.
I know.
Ok. Ok.

74
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,073
I told you.
I know,
I know.

75
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,743
Um...I'm steven.

76
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:32,744
Steven!
Steven!

77
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,911
Yeah.
That's
us both.

78
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,215
Ok.
All right.

79
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:39,718
Um...What are
you guys playing?
What's the game?

80
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:43,655
We can't tell you,
because then we couldn't
play it anymore.

81
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,222
Oh, ok. Wait,
I got one.

82
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,826
How...How tall
would you say you are?

83
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,193
Right now?
What do you think?

84
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,063
Uh...6...

85
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,099
One.

86
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,501
One! Gah!

87
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,503
Steven, you're killing me.

88
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,704
Thank you, steven.

89
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:01,805
You are terrible at this.

90
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:06,076
Hey, how's it going?

91
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:09,279
Hi, mate.

92
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:10,481
I was just lying here.

93
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:11,948
You can have the bed
by the window
if you want.

94
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:14,918
Oh, no, this one,
this one's cool.

95
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:18,388
You know, it's, um,
by the corkboard.

96
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:19,789
I'm lloyd.

97
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,225
Steven.
Hello, steven.

98
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,226
You're from...

99
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:26,028
England.
Right, right, yeah.

100
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,531
I've been there once
on this jewish
teen tour.

101
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,799
<i>Shalom, europe.</i>

102
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,467
I don't know.

103
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:34,136
What's your major?

104
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,205
Oh, I'm, like,
undeclared
for the time being.

105
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:38,240
You know,
it's just checking
stuff out, kind of.

106
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:39,509
I'm in the theater department.

107
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,514
I guess I'll unpack.

108
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,949
Uh, I wouldn't
unpack just yet,
if I were you.

109
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,117
Not until after the party.

110
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,552
You don't want people
messing with your stuff.

111
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,953
Oh, yeah, right.
Which party is that?

112
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,488
Our party.

113
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:55,557
Did they not tell you?
We're throwing a party
tonight.

114
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,558
Oh.

115
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,192
This entire campus is heaving

116
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,061
with beautiful women
that don't know
anyone yet.

117
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,799
We want them to know us.
Hence, the party.

118
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,334
"Hence, the party."
That's so cool.

119
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:09,037
All right, mate.
I'm gonna go run up
some girls on campus.

120
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,540
Well, actually,
if you want, I can
help you with that,

121
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:14,843
'cause, um, like,
I'm really good
at that kind of stuff.

122
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:15,844
Oh, yeah?

123
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:19,347
Yeah. It's, like,
my specialty.

124
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:22,350
All right. Good.
Yeah, you should
do that.

125
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:25,119
Um...I like
your shirt.

126
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:28,355
Oh, yeah?
Thanks. It's new.

127
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:31,058
Yeah. You should
probably put your
jacket back on, though.

128
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,693
It's gonna get cold outside.

129
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,729
Lloyd! Hey!

130
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,933
It's kind of scary,
living away from
home, huh?

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,201
I know.
Isn't it great?

132
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:44,572
I...I've never
lived with
anybody before.

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,173
But if we stick together...

134
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:49,009
Oh. Sorry.

135
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,010
Hello?

136
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:51,011
Hey, it's eric.

137
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,245
Hi, baby.

138
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,014
I'm pulling out
of the parking lot
right now,

139
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:56,016
and I'm starting
to cry a little bit.

140
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,518
Oh, baby...

141
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,520
I just want you to know
how much I love you,
baby. That's it.

142
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:02,088
Oh, I love you, too.

143
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:05,291
I can't wait till
I can make love
to you again.

144
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,926
Eric, my roommate's here.

145
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:10,396
I know, but if I can't
say those things to you,
I'll die.

146
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:12,966
Oh, sweetie...
I'm fine, don't
worry about me.

147
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,066
It's your time to have fun.

148
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,402
I'll call you
in, like, 15 minutes.

149
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,537
Ok.

150
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:37,689
That was embarrassing.

151
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:39,157
That was really, really...

152
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:40,492
that was embarrassing.
You guys...

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
I think she might come.

154
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,363
Uh, excuse me...

155
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:47,799
Um, we're, like,
having a party
tonight.

156
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,701
Do you, like, want to come?

157
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,436
Oh, I'm a senior.

158
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:52,938
Oh, that's cool.

159
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:56,207
No, sweetie.
That means I'm not
coming to your party.

160
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,442
Wow.

161
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,944
That sucked.

162
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:01,647
Do you, uh, wanna come
to the party tonight?

163
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:02,681
It's gonna be awesome.

164
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:05,017
Hi, uh, I heard
about your party.

165
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,884
And if you have not
already slotted
the position,

166
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,052
I would like to dj.

167
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,253
You..Are you good at it?

168
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,789
Oh, man, I spin...
and you have
never heard it...

169
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:15,092
it's like, straight
east coast thug hip-hop...

170
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,561
And brit pop.

171
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,362
I've got jesus, yes, I do.

172
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,964
I've got jesus, how 'bout you?

173
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,568
You know what I mean?

174
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:24,869
Um...

175
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:26,470
What does that,
what does that
sound like?

176
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,205
# You goin' down
when I pump my glock #

177
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,740
# like a time card in a clock #

178
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:32,409
# make your heart stop,
I'm colder than
an otter pop #

179
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,846
# there's no sunshine
in a castle on a sunday #

180
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,148
# I'm a carnivore,
you're my prey #

181
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,751
oh, my god.
Somebody help me!

182
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,119
Oh, god!

183
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,354
We're having a party.
Fourth floor. Party.

184
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,290
Hey, man,
that sounds great.
Yeah, I'll be there.

185
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:49,125
Um, I'll bring
some of my
fraternity brothers.

186
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:50,126
That's great.
All right, man.

187
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,294
Cool.
I'll
see you then.

188
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,529
Steve, you're
supposed to ask
ugly guys.

189
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,865
Hot girls,
ugly guys.
Ok? Ugly.

190
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,433
Well, um...
he's gonna take
all our women.

191
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,268
He's gonna take
all of our women.

192
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:02,706
Hey, having a party.
You gonna come?
You gonna come?

193
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,040
I want all of you to come.

194
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,041
Ok.

195
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,811
You know what this is?

196
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:08,945
It's a...Scrunchie?

197
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,246
That's right.
It's a scrunchie.

198
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,281
But it's also a signal.

199
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:14,083
When I'm in the room
with a lady,

200
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,450
I'll put this on the doorknob.

201
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,319
That means do not disturb.

202
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:18,553
Ok, cool, cool.

203
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:19,788
It's, like, when I'm
in the room with a lady,

204
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:22,057
put it on the doorknob,
that means, do not disturb.

205
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:22,992
That's right.

206
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,329
Is that really gonna happen?

207
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,764
'Course it's gonna happen.

208
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,809
Hey, how's it hangin'?

209
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,545
Good.

210
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,781
We're throwing a party tonight.

211
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:47,249
I don't know...
Do you want to come?

212
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,383
Yeah! Totally.
Where is it gonna be?

213
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:53,021
Uh, it's actually,
um, right here.

214
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,522
It...It's here?

215
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,757
Yeah.

216
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,458
So, you're inviting me

217
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:59,727
to a floor party
on my own floor.

218
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:02,997
Yeah, I guess you could
put it that way.

219
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,899
So, I wouldn't
have been able
to go otherwise?

220
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,333
No, I mean, uh...

221
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,036
<i>Has anyone
invited you yet?</i>

222
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:10,705
Just kidding.
I'll be there.

223
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,006
Thank you for inviting me.

224
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:24,584
# Tonight we got the mike on #

225
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:26,586
# crude with more luck
than horseshoe #

226
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:28,454
# while we fuse
together like rudy #

227
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:30,724
# 'cause we move
with 10 ton thrusters #

228
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,258
# the cosmopolitan cosmonaut #

229
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,895
# have been
denied again
like aneurysms #

230
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:37,330
# musical mannerisms are
parallel to cannibalism... #

231
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:40,400
so, I guess we
live on the same floor.

232
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:41,668
If you live on this floor.

233
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,970
I don't know where you live.

234
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,072
I...

235
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,140
# Inebriating,
leave you gaping open #

236
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,408
# nothing's safe in oakland #

237
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:50,177
# it's potent,
and murder is the slogan... #

238
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,512
I'm glad you came.
Are you having
a good time?

239
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,247
Yeah. Are you?

240
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:57,683
Yeah. I get
a little bit
shy at parties.

241
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,187
Whole communication thing.

242
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,989
It's difficult
for me to understand
your language.

243
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:06,391
Oh?

244
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,594
Really?

245
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:09,528
I'm joking.

246
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:12,832
You want to see my room?

247
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:13,899
Yeah.

248
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:21,874
So I said,
"mountain dew?
Mountain don't!"

249
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,210
I'm just kidding.

250
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,011
Uh, steven...

251
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,913
Uh...Guess
who I found

252
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,247
looking for his little boy?

253
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,683
Hey, party man!

254
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:35,120
Didn't
I just see you
at breakfast?

255
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,863
Hey. Do you know
how to do laundry?

256
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,631
Could you do me a favor?

257
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:47,766
Could you hold my hand?

258
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,069
Yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

259
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:53,671
It's just...
I'm having
a panic attack.

260
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,474
And it usually
goes away if I hold
somebody's hand

261
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,043
and I tell them
I'm having
a panic attack.

262
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,112
Ok. Ok.

263
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,013
I got...I got
to get out of here.

264
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,848
Uh, no, no.
It's ok, it's ok.

265
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,650
Um, I'll distract you.

266
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:09,619
Um...
I'm studying music.

267
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,822
What's your major?

268
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,124
I don't know yet.
I haven't decided.

269
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,459
You haven't picked
a major yet?!

270
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,428
God, what are you
trying to do to me?

271
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:21,064
Nothing. I'm trying
to distract you.

272
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,667
Uh...Um, maybe
the r.A. Can help.

273
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,669
No. No. No.
Uh, lucien. Lucien.

274
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:26,670
Hey, come here.

275
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,338
Hey, I, you know,
I see nothing.

276
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,573
I mean, do you guys
see a party? 'Cause
I don't. I... really.

277
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,746
Sorry, I didn't
see a scrunchie.

278
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:41,417
That's
'cause we're
just talking.

279
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:44,153
I love this song.

280
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:47,223
Great. Yeah.
Me, too.

281
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,590
Let's go listen to it.

282
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:49,926
# Good god #

283
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,061
# we gonna rock on to #

284
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,563
# electric avenue #

285
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,433
well, now I know
what all that college
tuition money...

286
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,869
dad. Please, stop.

287
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,503
What's going on?

288
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:06,943
Steven, I don't
want you to be overly
concerned about this,

289
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,979
but your mother
is considering
the idea...

290
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,613
Of getting a divorce.

291
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,119
What is that, huh?
It's ridiculous.

292
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,855
I don't think
it's that unusual.

293
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,723
It's a floor party
and it was the first
night. And I...

294
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,191
I don't think
it's that unusual.

295
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,559
No, I agree.
But I think...

296
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,094
I don't think
it's unfair for me
to feel...

297
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,395
Weird about it.
Feel threatened.

298
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,397
If I went to a party
with alicia
from color copy,

299
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,665
you wouldn't feel threatened?

300
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:31,867
If, all of a sudden,
I'm going out to a party,

301
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:32,868
you're not gonna
feel threatened?

302
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:34,736
Well, you know,
I mean, this is college,

303
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:36,171
and, I mean, this is my...

304
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,239
you think I...
oh-ho...

305
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,539
What? You
went through...

306
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:39,908
you think I don't
know what college
is like?

307
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,643
All of a sudden,
oh, you're the expert
on college.

308
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:43,845
I tried to go
to college 4 times.

309
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:44,778
Eric!

310
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,081
What happened?

311
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,083
I don't know.
She says she's miserable.

312
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,517
She doesn't want to have sex.

313
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,186
Uh, she feels dead inside,

314
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:54,388
life is passing
her by. I don't know.

315
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:58,192
I don't want
to talk about this.

316
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,593
Dad, we're
in the middle
of a party, ok?

317
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,061
This is my first
day at school...

318
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,797
steven, I've given
my entire life to you.

319
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:06,166
So, if I need
to talk to you,
you're gonna listen.

320
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,569
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,243
So...

322
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,780
Why do you think
mom feels dead inside?

323
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,949
I don't know.

324
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:26,752
Um...Um,
has she said why

325
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,187
she doesn't want
to have sex with you?

326
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:32,325
You know what, you're right.

327
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,759
This is not the time.

328
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:36,229
I don't want
to ruin your first
night, so, uh...

329
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:38,064
I'm gonna go crash
at uncle bill's.

330
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:39,632
Ok, good stuff.

331
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,134
I just wanted
to let you know that's
where I'm gonna be,

332
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,969
in case you want
to get in touch,
all right?
Cool, thanks.

333
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:43,970
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

334
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:44,971
Right. Yeah.

335
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,273
All right?
So have fun
at the party.

336
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:48,441
Thank you.
Have fun
at uncle bill's.

337
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:49,442
All right, I will.

338
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:50,376
Cool.

339
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:52,844
Bye.

340
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,851
Hey, mr. Karp.
Where you going?

341
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,653
You should party with us, huh?

342
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,355
Oh, no.
I gotta go.

343
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:06,458
Oh, your wife
get mad if you
come home late?

344
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,762
Where's the keg?

345
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,896
Yeah.
That's right.

346
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:13,731
I bet you could
drink a ton
of beer, huh?

347
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,267
I could. Today.

348
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,876
You got to watch out,
hal. Come on.

349
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:26,877
Here it comes, baby!

350
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,579
Bring it, h-bomb.

351
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,248
Ohh!

352
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:32,950
You asked for it,
hal. I feel terrible.

353
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:33,951
Darn it!

354
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,686
You asked for it.
That's right.

355
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,360
I know you're feeling alone,

356
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,894
and I know
that you're
feeling nervous.

357
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:46,230
I just got here!
I'm not... I'm...

358
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,631
you know what?
Maybe we should
break up.

359
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,867
Maybe we didn't
think hard enough
about that.

360
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:50,868
Maybe we should...

361
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,471
maybe we should.
Maybe we should.

362
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:54,738
I mean, we talked
about splitting up

363
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,173
till the summer anyway,

364
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,475
maybe we should just
go through with it.

365
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,542
Now you want to break up?

366
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,610
But you're, you just...

367
00:15:00,677 --> 00:15:01,911
<i>now you want
to break up?</i>

368
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:03,779
You get to college one day,

369
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,215
you're at college for one hour,

370
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:06,416
and all of a sudden
you want to break up?

371
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:07,417
You were the one who just...

372
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:09,152
how did...?
You know what?

373
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,153
Hey, hey, listen.

374
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,154
No, wait. Hey.

375
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:12,222
How does this idea sound?!

376
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,861
Now, now, I know
that you're
scared. Ok.

377
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,997
You know, being away
from mom and dad
and all that.

378
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:22,698
But, hey. I've been
here 6 years

379
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,067
and I'm still scared.

380
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,336
All right? Now, I...

381
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,172
I actually
wrote a poem
about my job.

382
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,208
Ok? And I really,
really think

383
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:33,509
that this would really help you

384
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,677
in your situation
right now. Ok?

385
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:42,884
If you enter my room
full of tears,

386
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:45,220
my hope is that
you will leave
with a smile.

387
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,424
Ok.

388
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:51,060
If you enter my room
glowing with love,

389
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,430
my hope is to share
in your warmth.

390
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:56,198
Ok, so when you're feeling low,

391
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,833
just knock
on my door
and say, "hello!"

392
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:00,569
You know?

393
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,372
See...I-I-it's
working.

394
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,907
And it's a little bit better.

395
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,943
And I'm really glad
that you're able
to laugh about this.

396
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,886
Have you seen rachel?

397
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,057
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

398
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,561
I'm sorry.
Uh, you know, um...

399
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,662
I'm just...

400
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,732
I'm, like, really
excited to be here.

401
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,534
Really?

402
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:37,238
Yeah, you know,
I'm just, I'm like,
just so happy.

403
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:38,339
You know? Um...

404
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:45,078
We're finally
on our own now.
You know? It's, uh...

405
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,946
It's a whole new era.

406
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,716
Yeah. I...I know
what you mean.

407
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:53,820
No one can
control us,
or...Or...

408
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,988
Tell us what to do!

409
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,923
Isn't it great?

410
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,658
It's amazing!

411
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,994
Yabba dabba doo!

412
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,362
Hey.

413
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,531
I'm in the dating pool
now, man. I'm available.

414
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm out there.
I'm looking
for a hot young chick.

415
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,169
Yes, I am.
You're what
is desirable.

416
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,672
Suzie zeta-jones.
Yes.

417
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,973
Catherine zeta's...

418
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:14,973
Sister.
Sister.

419
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,543
The younger one.
The much younger one.

420
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:19,011
Yes! Yes!
That's right,
man.

421
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:22,448
From now on,
we have total freedom.

422
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:25,217
And now is the time
in our lives

423
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:28,120
<i>when we are supposed
to be experiencing
everything.</i>

424
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:31,524
Exactly, exactly.
Like, I can,
like, uh...

425
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:33,125
Stay up till 11 now.

426
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:36,362
And I could pierce
anything I want.

427
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,498
Yeah, um, and, uh...

428
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:42,501
I can watch as much
tv as I want to.

429
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,537
You know, and eat
candy all day.

430
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,606
You know what we should do?

431
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,141
What?

432
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,342
We should have sex.

433
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:54,779
Oh, yeah?

434
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:56,847
Yeah. For fun.

435
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,619
Yeah. For fun.
Right. Ok.

436
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:02,620
Do you have a condom?

437
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:03,921
I have 8 condoms.

438
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,333
Ah...

439
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,634
Look at that.
That's not that big.

440
00:18:16,702 --> 00:18:18,403
No, it's like
the same size
as mine.

441
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,870
I have the gut
of an 18-year-old.

442
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:23,407
I have
the gut of
a 48-year-old.

443
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:24,841
Man...

444
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:26,743
It's pathetic.
What is she
complaining about?

445
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:30,380
All right.
It's not the size
of the gut, hal.

446
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,082
It's what the gut represents.

447
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,484
The poor woman's
done with raising
her children.

448
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:35,686
She wants to live a little bit.

449
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:38,722
The problem...
what this
is about, is...

450
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,425
That the women,
they don't
appreciate you.

451
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:43,026
That is the real problem.

452
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:47,331
Oh, I'm so sorry
that I worked
and supported you

453
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:49,032
for 20 years!

454
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:54,504
I should have
been, um, learning
to salsa dance

455
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:56,972
so you wouldn't
feel dead inside!

456
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,774
Yeah.

457
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,209
Why didn't you
take her salsa dancing?

458
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,611
'Cause he works for a living!

459
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:02,845
That's right, man!

460
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,113
Have you not been listening?

461
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,948
I'm bringing home
the bacon, ok? Ok?

462
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,416
I understand that.

463
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,719
<i>But why didn't you
take her salsa dancing?</i>

464
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:12,288
Because I don't want to!

465
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:13,956
Well, I'm sure
she didn't want
to cook you dinner

466
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:15,291
every night
for the last 20 years

467
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,592
and sacrifice her life
to raise your child,

468
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,394
but she still did it,
didn't she, hal?

469
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:20,396
Oh, man.

470
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:22,998
That makes sense.

471
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,668
What do you mean,
that makes sense?

472
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:27,035
Hey, whoa, whoa.

473
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,638
Are you saying I'm wrong?

474
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:31,906
No! You're not
wrong, hal.

475

You're just...
Maybe...

476
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,411
Less than right.

Go call her.
