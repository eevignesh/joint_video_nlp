(679,1277)I'm the dumplings. 
WOLOWITZ
(676,1194)Yes, you are.

(678,1716)Come to papa, you un—kosher delight.
(686,1716)(TO PENNY) I'm talking to the food.
(1051,1194)PENNY
(679,1103)Sit over there.
(454,1724)SHELDON ENTERS CARRYING A BOX OF BABY WIPES.

LEONARD/WOLOWITZ
(675,1657)No, don't ask! / No, don't, don't.
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(679,1752)I'll tell you why. I had to sanitize
(675,1579)my hands because the university
(677,1753)replaced the paper towels in the rest
(677,1453)rooms with hot air blowers.
(1051,1194)PENNY
(679,1745)I thought blowers were more sanitary.

(675,2322)No, no, stop. / Why? *

(677,2322)Hot air blowers are incubators and *
(679,1687)spewers of bacteria and pestilence.
(677,1723)Frankly it would be more hygienic if
(677,1782)they just had a plague—infested gibbon

(1051,1194)PENNY
(677,1604)Oh. (TO LEONARD) Well that was
(676,986)unpleasant.

(677,1606)Oh, gee, Raj, do you think maybe
(679,1636)someday you'll be able to talk in
(679,1603)front of me without being drunk?
(452,966)HE SHRUGS "MAYBE."

WOLOWITZ
(679,1253)So what's your news?
(1052,1395)KOOTHRAPPALI
(676,1753)Remember that little planetary object
(679,1632)I spotted beyond the Kuiper Belt?
(1051,1251)LEONARD
(677,1395)Oh sure, 2008NQ—Sub—l7. 
KOOTHRAPPALI
(677,1657)Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.
(674,1597)Anyway, because of my discovery,
(676,1694)People Magazine is naming me one of

(678,2322)That's incredible, Raj. / *

(677,2322)to watch as they challenge the *

(1054,1252)SHELDON
(679,1695)If I had a million guesses, I never
(675,1336)would have gotten that.
(1052,1395)KOOTHRAPPALI
(679,1724)It's pretty cool. They've got me in
(675,2322)with a guy who's doing something about *
(677,1251)hunger in Indonesia. 
LEONARD
(676,1395)Ending it? 
KOOTHRAPPALI
(676,1665)Let's hope. And a psychotherapist
(675,1723)who's using dolphins to rehabilitate
(676,1781)prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the
(678,1629)charming independent film "Juno."
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(677,1190)Oh, I'd so do her.
(1051,1251)LEONARD
(676,1307)You'd do the dolphins.
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(677,1636)Do I get an honorable mention for

WOLOWITZ
(674,1395)What's your narrative? 
KOOTHRAPPALI
(679,1723)I am a humble boy from New Delhi who
(678,1635)overcame poverty and prejudice to
(677,1249)reach for the stars.
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(676,1403)Poverty? Your father's a
(679,1687)gynecologist. He drives a Bentley.
(1052,1395)KOOTHRAPPALI
(679,1252)It's a lease. 
SHELDON
(679,1752)I'm confused. Was there some sort of
(676,1664)peer review committee to determine
(675,1691)which scientists would be included?
(1052,1395)KOOTHRAPPALI
(676,1687)Peer review? It's People Magazine.
(676,1161)People picked me.
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(674,1395)What people?

(1054,1252)SHELDON
(676,1778)Yes, but exactly who are these people?
(674,1723)What are their credentials? How are
(677,2322)they qualified? What makes *

(1052,1395)KOOTHRAPPALI
(686,1743)(STRUGGLES FOR AN ANSWER, THEN) Boy,
(679,1724)I'll bet Ellen Page's friends aren't

(1051,1251)LEONARD
(677,1635)He came over last night with some

(678,869)others.
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(674,1695)What Leonard's trying to say is you
(675,1336)were a colossal asshat.
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(677,1752)Oh, I beg to differ. Of the three of
(676,1745)us, I was by far the most supportive.
(1051,1251)LEONARD
(676,1161)Really? Do tell.

(677,1779)How will Raj ever reach true greatness

LEONARD
(677,1545)Do they feature in your story?
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(675,1607)No. Anyway, when I was eight, a
(675,1753)Montgomery Ward delivery van ran over
(678,1307)our family cat, Lucky.
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(676,1252)Lucky? 
SHELDON
(676,986)Yes, Lucky.

(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(677,2322)Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue. *
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(674,1783)While others mourned Lucky, I realized
(677,1725)his untimely demise provided me with
(677,1696)the opportunity to replace him with
(679,1774)something more suited to my pet needs.

(676,1662)Please. Nothing so pedestrian. I
(675,1161)wanted a griffin.

(674,961)A griffin?

(674,1161)And mythological.
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(679,1462)Irrelevant. I was studying
(677,1721)recombinant DNA technology and I was
(678,1725)confident I could create one, but my
(676,1723)parents were unwilling to secure the
(677,1716)necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.
(677,1637)Of course, my sister got swimming
(679,1511)lessons when she wanted them.
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ

(342,2314)September 15, 2008 FINAL DRAFT (II/E)
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(675,1754)My point is if Koothrappali is moving
(678,1812)on to a new life of shallow, undeserved
(679,1810)fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to
(678,1336)create a better cohort.
(1051,1251)LEONARD
(676,1574)You want to breed a new friend?
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(678,1774)That's one option. But consider this:
(678,1753)The Japanese are doing some wonderful
(675,1811)work with artificial intelligence. You
(678,1692)combine that with some animatronics
(679,1783)from the Imagineers over at Disney and
(677,1810)next thing you know, we're playing Halo
(675,1716)with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.
(1049,1277)WOLOWITZ
(679,1666)Sheldon, don't take this the wrong
(675,1424)way, but... you're insane.
(1051,1251)LEONARD
(678,1724)That may well be, but the fact is it
(675,1862)wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
(1054,1252)SHELDON
(677,1694)For the record, it could kill us to
(675,1577)meet new people. They could be
(675,1724)murderers or the carriers of unusual
(676,1782)pathogens. (TO WOLOWITZ) And I'm not
