(504,951)INT. HAIR SALON - DAY
(501,1024)TIGHT CLOSE UP - STEVEN
(502,2096)STEVEN KARP is a skinny, baby-faced, slightly awkward eighteen-year-old young man.
(501,2095)The camera slowly widens out to reveal that he is sitting in a chair at a hair salon. He is
(502,2158)speaking to his very nerdy looking friend, JACK, who represents the extent of his social life
(503,763)in high school.
(501,2093)The hair dresser puts a smock around him. Steven points to a photograph in a book of
(504,2122)European Chic hairstyles. As Steven speaks, the hairdresser sprays his hair with a water
(503,614)bottle.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(924,1076)(to Jack)
(804,1647)Do you know I grew seven inches senior year?
(924,1295)(points to his mouth)
(804,1679)Everything from here up, it's all new. Things are
(802,1649)gonna change for me. Sixty percent of people
(803,1347)meet their spouses at college.
(1102,1206)JACK
(801,1086)You, and a girl?
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1702)Why not? These girls at college, they don't know
(803,1858)me. 
CUT TO:
(504,843)INT. STORE - DAY
(502,2075)Steven is buying a poster of Munch's "The Scream" and a set of Martini glasses and a
(502,631)shaken
(1102,1206)JACK
(801,1708)Yeah, they don't know you threw up on the bus in
(801,1253)fifth grade. 
STEVEN
(804,1651)Exactly. I don't have to live with that anymore.
(805,1325)‘Cause they don't know that.
(1102,1206)JACK
(800,1628)And they don't know that you cried when you
(801,1283)failed your drivers ed. test.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1003)I didn't cry.
(1102,1206)JACK
(801,1095)You kinda cried.
(2002,2084)CUT
(1701,1764)TO:
(504,1039)INT. STEVEN'S ROOM - DAY
(502,2091)Steven is doing curls with an isometric machine that lifts you up in the air. He has to try
(501,888)way too hard to do it.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1605)The point is, I'm tall, handsome. I've gained
(801,1578)weight. This is the beginning of a new era.
(1102,1206)JACK
(804,1638)But come on, you're just the same guy you've
(802,1715)always been, except now you have a short haircut
(802,1172)and a martini mixer?
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1720)I'm the same guy? Well, okay, that's interesting. I
(802,1595)guess old Steve would have done this then.
(502,2094)Steve puts down the weights, then stands on his bed and grabs a classic X-Men comic
(503,1606)book. He holds it up. Then, slowly tears it down the middle.
(1102,1206)JACK
(804,1730)Dude! What the hell are you doing?!! I would have
(801,992)taken that!
(1702,1858)CUT TO:
(504,972)EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
(502,2099)Steven in what he thinks is a fancy shirt, stands outside with his mother DEBRA and his
(501,2057)father HAL. Hal is running in and out of the house loading the car as the scene plays.
(1104,1180)HAL
(804,1560)Nice fancy haircut. You should join those
(804,1451)Backstreet Boys. Watch out ladies.
(504,1792)He musses up his hair. This is not the reaction Steven was looking for.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1413)I don't look like a Backstreet Boy.
(1104,1180)HAL
(801,1213)What, that's bad now?
(504,1441)Mom looks at Steven like he is sitting on death row.
(1104,1238)DEBRA
(924,1038)(sadly)
(804,1692)It's over. Things are never going to be the same.
(1104,1180)HAL
(924,1063)(laughs)
(801,1012)Thank God.
(924,1380)(off of her angry reaction)
(802,907)Sorry.
(504,1016)Hal exits to get another bag.
(1104,1238)DEBRA
(804,1725)I was a good mom, wasn't I? I drove more than all
(801,1110)the other moms?
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1707)You were a great mom. Look at me. I never killed
(802,1688)anyone. I'm not in a gutter shooting up heroin. I
(802,1729)didn't even have sex, although I tried Q hard. You
(802,1270)did it. I poop in the potty.
(1104,1238)DEBRA
(924,1186)(she hugs him)
(801,1689)You're a good boy, Steven. I'm so proud of you.
(502,1489)Steven gets in the car. Then, waves from the window.
(1104,1180)HAL
(924,1051)(joking)
(804,1707)Don't go. Don't leave me alone with your mother.
(1104,1238)DEBRA
(802,1013)Stop it, Hal.
(502,816)Steven drives off.
(1104,1180)HAL
(804,1624)Please, take me with you. Take her with you.
(804,962)Help me!
(504,1297)Debra whacks Hal, then walks in the house.

(500,1109)ANGLE ON - ELEVATOR DOORS
(502,2152)Steven walks out of the elevator. He looks scared, but then takes a deep breath as if he is
(503,1755)putting on the face of his new persona|ity-- POPULAR SOCIAL GUY.
(504,2133)He turns and walks down the hall. He looks into open dorm rooms as he walks and sees:

(802,1246)deal, but... 
LUCIEN
(801,1694)That's perfectly normal. Freshman year is rough.
(801,1643)The freshman fifteen, the sexual p...pressures.
(802,1555)Gonorrhea is back. But hey, if it wasn't a
(803,1678)nightmare, they wouldn't give me free rent to be

(804,1249)But it will be okay, right?

(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1138)I guess I'll unpack.
(1104,1232)LLOYD
(804,1831)I wouldn't unpack just yet. Not until after the party. You

(802,1270)Sure. 
(he takes her hand)
(1104,1263)RACHEL
(804,1715)I'm having a panic attack. It usually goes away if I
(802,1722)can hold someone's hand and tell them I'm having

(804,1686)Lucien, what are you supposed to do for a panic
(802,934)attack?
(504,2170)Rachel looks angrily at Marshall. Lucien eyes fill with his own panic at having to deal with a
(503,661)problem.
(1104,1246)LUCIEN
(924,1176)(very nen/ous)
(804,1622)P-P-Panic attack? Oh, God. I wish I had my

(1104,1219)LIZZIE
(804,1711)I'm not one of your buddies who's just gonna kiss

STEVEN
(801,1112)What happened?
(1104,1180)HAL
(804,1630)I don't know. She says she's miserable. She
(802,1694)doesn't want to have sex. She feels dead inside.
(804,1721)Life is passing her by ...yip, yip, yip... I don't know.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1724)I don't want to talk about this. We're in the middle

(1104,1180)HAL
(801,1701)You know what, I'm your father and I need to talk

(1102,1253)STEVEN
(924,1066)(scared)
(804,1062)I'm sorry, dad.
(504,1407)Hal tries to mellow out. He's a little embarrassed.
(1102,1441)STEVEN (CONT'D)
(802,1307)So, mom feels dead inside?
(1104,1180)HAL
(800,1007)Apparently.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(802,1396)She never mentioned that to me.
(1104,1180)HAL
(802,1272)She wouldn't, would she?
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1715)Why do you think mom doesn't want to have sex?
(1104,1180)HAL
(801,1692)You know what, you're right, this isn't the time. I
(802,1655)don't wanna ruin your first night. I'm gonna go

(1102,1253)STEVEN
(800,1228)Are you sure, ‘cause I...
(504,718)Hal gets up.

(801,1527)find me. We'll talk about this tomorrow.

(801,1641)with one friend. Me. Now I've written a poem
(802,1421)about my job, I think it might help.
(924,1325)(reading from a poem)
(804,1699)If you enter my room full of tears, my hope is that
(801,1684)you will leave with a smile. If you enter my room
(801,1681)feeling like a stranger, my hope is that when you
(803,1665)leave, we will know each other. If you enter my
(803,1648)room glowing with love, my hope is to share in
(801,1351)your warmth. Does that help?
(504,1579)Marshall looks embarrassed that he made her listen to this.
(1104,1320)MARSHALL
(804,1467)I am so sorry, Rachel. I had no idea.
(504,1473)Rachel cracks up laughing. Her panic attack is gone.

(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1705)Yeah, I'm just really... excited about being here at

(804,1247)I'm just...so...so...happy.
(1104,1219)LIZZIE
(804,1654)I so know what you mean. It's like today is the

(802,1699)can control us or tell us what to do. It's amazing.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1682)Yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking about...

(1104,1187)RON
(804,1598)My ex-girlfriend was always on my ass, too.
(1104,1180)HAL
(802,1589)Of course she was. Because she was your

(504,1530)Hal hits it into Ron's cup. Ron drinks. Lloyd walks over.
(1104,1232)LLOYD
(804,1713)Mr. Karp, if I may. I think your problem is that you
(803,1665)need to remove the masks of your daily life and

(1104,1180)HAL
(801,1603)Yeah, I have the gut of an eighteen year old.
(801,1377)What's she complaining about?
(1104,1232)LLOYD
(804,1620)It's not the gut, it's what it represents. She's
(801,1715)finished raising her children and now she wants to

(1104,1180)HAL
(801,1646)These women, they don't appreciate anything.
(804,1653)Hey... I'm sorry that I had a job and worked for
(801,1528)twenty years. I didn't mean to... pay for

(1104,1180)HAL
(804,1256)Because, I don't want to.
(1104,1232)LLOYD
(801,1696)Well, I'm sure she didn't want to cook you dinner
(802,1717)every day for twenty years either. She didn't want
(801,1683)to sacrifice her life to raise a child, but she did it.
(1104,1187)RON
(801,1141)That makes sense.
(1104,1180)HAL

(502,1260)Students are walking to their first classes.
(1702,1858)CUT TO:
(504,1346)INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
(502,1803)CU - Steven opens his eyes. He has a look of contentment on his face.
(502,834)CU - Lizzie in bed.
(502,1086)CU - Steven turns to see Lizzie.
(502,1427)STEVEN'S P.O.V. - A LARGE HAIRY MAN'S FOOT
(1702,1858)CUT TO:
(504,1089)INT. LIZZIE & RACHEL'S ROOM
(501,1356)We reveal that Lizzie is in fact alone in her bed.
(1964,2046)CUT
(1701,1764)TO:
(504,997)INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM
(502,2149)Steven realizes Lizzie is gone. Steven sits up and sees that he is lying next to his dad. He
(503,1523)looks at his dad's face, which lays next to Steven's feet.
(502,974)CLOSE UP - HAL'S FACE
(502,2163)Some one has drawn on his face with a magic marker. On his cheek it says in block letters
(505,2071)"SHUT THIS." A booger has been drawn on his upper lip and on his forehead it says,
(505,802)"STEVE'S DAD."
(502,1560)Steven looks across the room at Lloyd, who stares at him.
(1104,1232)LLOYD
(804,1606)I didn't do it. I went to the bathroom for five
(803,1695)minutes and they were on him like a pack of rats.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(802,911)Great.
(504,756)Hal wakes up.
(1104,1180)HAL
(924,1070)(QFOQQY)
(804,1305)Hey, kiddo. Good morning.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1058)Morning, Dad.
(504,1858)Hal is oblivious to the markings on his face. 
CUT TO:
(504,1324)INT. LIZZIE & RACHEL'S ROOM - MORNING
(504,2136)Rachel and Lizzie are getting up. Lizzie looks at the large picture of her and her boyfriend
(503,1256)in the middle of her huge photo montage.
(1104,1263)RACHEL
(801,1362)With Steven? The skinny guy?
(1104,1219)LIZZIE
(924,1040)(guilty)
(804,1620)I made a terrible mistake. I have a boyfriend.
(1104,1263)RACHEL
(924,1058)(smiles)
(802,1466)Oh my God. I totally misjudged you.
(1104,1219)LIZZIE
(800,1158)Am I a bad person?
(1104,1263)RACHEL
(804,1415)No. Come on, let's get breakfast.
(1104,1219)LIZZIE
(802,904)Okay.
(1702,1858)CUT TO:
(504,1087)INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
(504,863)MUSIC UP: SCORE
(502,1238)Steven and Hal are standing in the suite.
(1104,1180)HAL
(924,1116)(to Steven)
(802,1347)Come, walk your old man out.
(504,2080)Marshall walks through toward the bathroom. He sees the markings, but does not say
(502,665)anything.
(501,2077)They walk toward the door that takes you to the hallway. On the way, Ron walks past.
(1104,1187)RON
(802,1078)Good-bye, Hal.
(1104,1180)HAL
(802,1042)See ya‘, Ron.
(501,1527)They walk down the hallway and pass Lizzie on the way.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(924,1179)(super cheery)
(802,1073)Good morning.
(1104,1219)LIZZIE
(924,1177)(odd - distant)
(802,992)Oh... Hey.
(504,2138)Her reply surprises Steven. He looks back at her as she walks away quickly and wonders
(501,1285)what it all meant. They get on the elevator.
(1702,1858)CUT TO:
(504,842)EXT. DORM - DAY
(502,1042)Steven and Hal exit the dorm.
(1104,1180)HAL
(802,1716)Steven, I don't really feel like I'm in any position to
(802,1686)give advice, but... have a good time. Work hard,
(803,1707)but have a good time. You don't want to wind up
(803,1653)like me screwing your life up then waking up in
(803,1137)bed with your son.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(924,1454)(off his dad's facial markings)
(804,1680)If I were you I'd jump in a shower, wash my face
(803,1264)really well and start fresh.
(1104,1180)HAL
(804,1391)I'm sorry I ruined your first night.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(801,1396)There's no reason to be sorry. It
(801,960)was fine.
(1104,1180)HAL
(804,1134)I love you, Steven.
(504,800)He hugs Steven.
(1102,1253)STEVEN
(804,1078)I love you, dad.
(1104,1180)HAL
(924,1051)(joking)
(804,1599)Hey, call me the next time you have a party.
(504,792)Hal walks away.
(504,814)MUSIC SWELLS.
(502,2019)Steven puts his bag of books over his shoulder and walks back toward the bustling
(502,2000)campus and his new life. A moment later Lloyd, Ron and Marshall walk up to him.
(1104,1232)LLOYD
(802,1253)Come along Steven. 
STEVEN
(802,1306)Sure. Where are we going?
(1104,1187)RON
(801,1320)To class. 
MARSHALL
(804,1682)I hear that they don't take attendance in college.
(1104,1187)RON
(804,1181)Let's not go to class.
(501,761)They all laugh.
(1263,1435)THE END
