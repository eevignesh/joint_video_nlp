(1167,1370)FRASIER
(751,1734)(FIRMLY, WITH CONCERN) Listen to

(746,1855)Yes, Dr. Crane. on line four we have
(745,1854)Russell from Kirkland. He feels like

(1168,1371)FRASIER
(746,1764)This is Doctor Frasier Crane. I&#39;m
(749,1571)listening. 
RUSSELL (v.o.)
(746,1856)well, I&#39;ve been feeling, sort of, you
(747,1420)know, depressed lately.
(1169,1372)FRASIER
(749,1571)For how long? 
RUSSELL (v.o.)
(748,1756)Oh, the last seven or eight years.
(1169,1372)FRASIER
(748,1573)Go on. 
RUSSELL (v.o.)
(751,1736)I don&#39;t know, my life&#39;s not going
(750,1758)anywhere. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s bad.
(751,1859)It&#39;s just the same old apartment, the
(751,1759)same old job, the same old people,
(749,1789)day after day. Sometimes I just...
(449,2167)ROZ SIGNALS FROM THE BOOTH THAT TIME IS RUNNING SHORT AND
(451,1273)FRASIER HAS TO WRAP THIS UP.
(1149,1354)FRASIER
(725,1843)Russell, we&#39;re nearing the end of our
(725,1842)hour. Let me see if I can cut to the
(727,1803)chase by using myself as an example.
(728,1631)Six months ago I was living in
(729,1782)Boston. My wife had left me, which
(728,1835)was very painful, then she came back,
(728,1813)which was excruciating. I thought I
(731,1755)could forgive her indiscretion but
(732,1848)there was this nagging little hint of
(734,1666)resentment, this minute lack of
(733,1757)trust, this overwhelming desire to
(737,1791)shove a grapefruit in her face. on
(736,1761)top of that, my practice had grown
(738,1853)stagnant and my social life consisted
(739,1794)of hanging around a bar night after
(740,1732)night. Suddenly I realized I was
(741,1644)clinging to a life that wasn&#39;t
(740,1828)working anymore. I knew I had to do
(745,1860)something, anything. So I put an end
(745,1892)to the marriage and moved back here to
(745,1853)my hometown of Seattle. Go Seahawks!
(750,1917)I took action, Russell and you can too.
(747,1896)Move, change, do something. If it&#39;s a
(749,1867)mistake, do something else. Will you
(751,1895)do that, Russell? will you? Russell?
(763,1891)(TURNING TO ROZ) I think we lost him.
(2238,2284)5.
(2215,2282)(3)
(2256,2302)6.
(2233,2302)(B)
(1166,1251)ROZ
(746,1793)No, we cut to the news about thirty
(748,1096)seconds ago.
(446,2218)FRASIER TAKES OFF HIS HEADSET, GETS UP AND HEADS INTO ROZâ€™S
(445,826)CONTROL ROOM.
(1169,1371)FRASIER
(747,1794)oh, for crying out loud. I finally
(746,1764)bare my soul to all of Seattle and
(746,1823)they&#39;re listening to "Chopper Dave&#39;s
(746,1733)Rush-Hour Roundup"? At least the
(749,1753)rest of the show was good. (THEN)
(750,1640)It was a good show, wasn&#39;t it?
(1167,1252)ROZ
(747,1754)Here. (HANDS HIM A SLIP OF PAPER)
(749,1333)Your brother called.
(1171,1374)FRASIER
(748,1827)You know, in the trade, we call that
(750,1849)avoidance. Don&#39;t change the subject.
(748,1311)What did you think?
(445,1218)SHE POINTS TO HER CONSOLE.
(1171,1255)ROZ
(751,1829)Did I ever show you what this button
(751,895)does?
(1174,1377)FRASIER
(753,1770)I&#39;m not a piece of Lalique. I can
(751,1798)handle criticism. How was I today?
(1160,1244)ROZ
(743,1548)Let&#39;s see. You dropped two
(743,1701)commercials, you left a total of
(743,1855)twenty-eight seconds of dead air, you
(743,1671)scrambled the call letters, you
(743,1792)spilled yogurt on the control board
(743,1824)and you kept referring to Jerry with
(742,1637)the identity crisis as "Jeff."
(1163,1370)FRASIER
(753,1784)(PAUSE) You say my brother called.

(1160,1506)NILES (v.o.)
(738,1787)So I said to the gardner, "Yoshi, I

(436,1390)SEATTLEâ€™S POPULAR COFFEE HOUSES.
(1163,1782)NILES (V.O.) (CONTâ€™D)
(741,1762)If I want to rake gravel every ten
(739,1843)minutes to maintain my inner harmony,
(742,1425)I&#39;ll move to Yokohama."
(1649,1845)CUT TO:
(2274,2321)9.
(2252,2319)(C)
(562,1415). O OUS - INUOUS -
(471,1466)(Niles, Frasier, Waitress, Extras)
(463,2352)FRASIER AND HIS BROTHER, QB, NILES CRANE, STAND AT THE COUNTER.
(463,1378)FRASIER HAS HIS NOSE IN A MENU.
(1183,1588)NILES (CONTâ€™D)
(762,1810)Well, this offends him so he starts
(763,1872)pulling up Marisâ€™ prized camellias by
(763,1783)the handful. I couldn&#39;t stand for
(763,1751)that, so I marched right into the
(761,1722)morning room and locked the door
(763,1782)until he cooled down. Tell me you
(762,1773)would have handled it differently,
(764,990)Frasier.
(459,1378)AFTER A BEAT, FRASIER LOOKS UP.
(1183,1389)FRASIER
(763,1661)Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Niles, I didn&#39;t
(764,1652)realize you&#39;d stopped talking.
(1183,1325)NILES
(764,1895)You haven&#39;t listened to a word I said.
(1185,1391)FRASIER
(763,1784)Niles, you&#39;re a psychiatrist. You
(764,1723)know what it&#39;s like to listen to
(764,1815)people prattling on endlessly about
(764,1350)their mundane lives.
(1184,1327)NILES
(764,1877)Touche. And on that subject, I heard
(765,1232)your show today.
(2208,2283)10. 
(C)
(1153,1359)FRASIER
(729,1297)And? 
NILES
(731,2017)You know what I think about pop psychiatry.
(1154,1360)FRASIER
(732,1847)Yes, yes; I know what you think about
(733,1787)everything. when was the last time
(733,1665)you had an unexpressed thought?
(1155,1301)NILES
(737,1295)I&#39;m having one now.
(431,2143)THEY BOTH CHUCKLE GOOD-NATUREDLY. A WAITRESS APPROACHES.
(1157,1393)WAITRESS
(738,1367)You guys ready? 
FRASIER
(748,1904)(TO WAITRESS) Two cafe latte supremos.
(436,2097)NILES MOVES TO A CHAIR AND BEGINS TO DUST IT OFF WITH A
(437,1603)HANDKERCHIEF. HE OFFERS IT TO FRASIER.
(1164,1634)FRASIER (CONTâ€™D)
(741,1151)No, thank you.
(1164,1310)NILES
(745,1739)So, Frasier, how are you doing on
(744,1009)your own?
(1169,1376)FRASIER
(749,1894)I&#39;m fine. I love my new life. I love
(748,1955)the solitude. I miss Frederick like the
(749,1886)dickens, of course. He&#39;s quite a boy.
(750,1988)He&#39;s playing goalie on the pee wee soccer
(752,1979)team now. He&#39;s a chip off the old block.
(2237,2312)11. 
(C)
(1181,1320)NILES
(756,1383)You hated sports. 
FRASIER
(753,1803)And so does he, but the fresh airâ€™s
(754,1136)good for him.
(451,1319)THEY BOTH LAUGH AT THIS. 
NILES
(754,1774)This has been fun, Frasier, but we
(753,1864)have a problem. That&#39;s why I thought
(753,1381)we should talk. 
FRASIER
(754,1319)our Dad? 
NILES
(756,1653)I&#39;m afraid so. one of his old
(753,1834)buddies from the police force called
(753,1773)this morning. He went over to see
(753,1886)him. Found him on the bathroom floor.
(1180,1382)FRASIER
(754,1318)oh my God. 
NILES
(754,1492)No, it&#39;s okay, he&#39;s fine.

(754,1173)His hip again?

NILES
(729,1782)Well, I know this isn&#39;t going to be
(732,1719)anyoneâ€™s favorite solution, but I
(732,1752)took the liberty of checking out a

(1153,1295)NILES
(733,1786)well, you certainly can&#39;t take care
(736,1849)of him. You&#39;re just getting your new

(1157,2419)FRASIER *
(735,1729)Absolutely. Besides, we&#39;ve never
(736,1848)been sympatico. When I was a child I
(739,1762)once rode in the car with him from
(739,1852)Seattle to Spokane and the only thing
(739,1852)he said to me was, "I think we&#39;ve got
(741,1849)a problem with your brother Frasier."
(1161,1303)NILES
(743,1765)Yes, well, and, of course, I can&#39;t
(743,1370)take care of him. 
FRASIER

(729,1840)with your favorite beer, Ballantines,

(745,1766)That implies we were acquainted at

(747,1796)into his new "bachelor quarters" so

FRASIER
(742,1794)Yes, we Crane boys sure know how to

(1167,1631)FRASIER (CONTâ€™D)
(742,1793)So, do you like what I&#39;ve done with
(741,1855)the place? Every piece was carefully
(740,1825)chosen. The lamp, Corbu. The chair
(740,1702)by Eames. This sofa is an exact

(1147,1353)FRASIER
(727,1718)It&#39;s a style of decorating. It&#39;s
(725,1780)called eclectic. The theory behind
(728,1749)it is, if you have great pieces of
(727,1811)furniture, it doesn&#39;t matter if they
(722,1555)match. They&#39;ll go together.

(725,1013)afford it.
(420,1587)SHE SMILES AT FRASIER. S0 DOES MARTIN.
(1150,1357)FRASIER
(725,1837)Uh, yes, well, um, Miss Moon, tell us
(727,1557)a little bit about yourself.
(1151,1325)DAPHNE
(726,1829)Well, I&#39;m originally from Manchester,
(728,957)England.
(1153,1359)FRASIER
(729,1777)Oh really. Did you hear that, Dad?
(1152,1329)MARTIN
(734,1843)I&#39;m three feet away. There&#39;s nothing
(731,1382)wrong with my hearing.
(1158,1332)DAPHNE
(737,1817)I&#39;ve only been in the U.S. for a few
(734,1816)months but I have quite an extensive
(735,1817)background in home care and physical
(736,1669)therapy, as you can see from my
(739,1268)resume. I also...
(435,1027)SHE LOOKS AT MARTIN.
(2206,2281)29. 
(J)
(1149,1582)DAPHNE (CONTâ€™D)
(725,1743)You were a policeman, weren&#39;t you?
(1144,1319)MARTIN
(725,1437)Yeah. How did you know?
(1147,1319)DAPHNE
(727,1737)I must confess, I&#39;m a bit psychic.
(725,1744)Nothing big. Just little things I
(727,1805)sense about people. It&#39;s not like I
(726,1806)can pick the lottery. If I could, I
(725,1778)wouldn&#39;t be talking to the likes of
(726,1349)you two, now would I?
(426,1587)SHE LAUGHS. MARTIN FINDS THAT AMUSING.
(1152,1355)FRASIER
(730,1810)Perhaps I should describe the duties
(730,1506)around here. You would be
(730,1325)responsible for... 
DAPHNE
(741,1694)(T0 FRASIER) Wait a minute, I&#39;m
(731,1784)getting something on you. You&#39;re a
(736,1361)florist. 
FRASIER
(734,1411)No, I&#39;m a psychiatrist. 
DAPHNE
(735,1729)Well, it comes and goes. Usually
(741,1821)it&#39;s strongest during my time of the
(736,1667)month. Oh, I guess I let out a
(741,1636)little secret there, didn&#39;t I?
(1131,1336)FRASIER
(709,1779)It&#39;s safe with us. (CHECKING WATCH)
(706,1517)Well, I think we&#39;ve learned
(709,1812)everything we need to know about you.
(707,1701)And a dash extra. Thank you very
(708,1449)much. We&#39;ll be in touch.
(1135,1307)DAPHNE
(720,1764)(TO MARTIN) You must be very proud
(712,1575)of your son the psychiatrist.
(1134,1310)MARTIN
(714,1796)Sons. Two sons. Two shrinks. They
(714,1707)took after their mother, rest her
(717,1829)soul. She was one too. It was quite
(717,1678)a household. I couldn&#39;t scratch
(715,1611)myself without being analyzed.
(1143,1316)DAPHNE
(718,1624)We Brits don&#39;t believe much in
(720,1805)psychiatry. I mean, isn&#39;t that what
(724,1199)friends are for?
(1149,1353)FRASIER
(723,1284)That&#39;s very quaint.
(1151,1324)DAPHNE
(735,1837)(TO EDDIE) You&#39;re a dog, aren&#39;t you?
(1153,1358)FRASIER
(727,1692)well, we&#39;ll be calling you, Miss
(728,866)MOON .
(2186,2261)30. 
(J)
(2209,2286)31. 
(J)
(1148,1324)MARTIN
(726,1435)why wait? You&#39;re hired.
(1151,1323)DAPHNE
(726,1356)Oh wonderful! 
FRASIER
(728,1778)Excuse me. Aren&#39;t we getting ahead
(728,1659)of ourselves, here? I think we
(730,1680)should discuss this. Privately.
(1153,1325)DAPHNE
(729,1566)Oh, of course you should. I
(729,1842)completely understand. I&#39;ll just pop
(733,1842)into the loo. You do have one, don&#39;t
(729,1359)you? 
FRASIER
(740,1328)(INDICATING) Yes. 
DAPHNE
(734,1172)I love America.
(432,1363)DAEHEE E311 . 
FRASIER
(736,1815)Dad, what do you think you&#39;re doing?
(1157,1332)MARTIN
(736,1850)You wanted me to pick one... I picked
(737,1366)one. 
FRASIER
(739,1810)But she&#39;s a kook. I don&#39;t like her.
(2206,2283)32. 
(J)
(1145,1322)MARTIN
(722,1686)What does it matter? She&#39;s only
(722,1706)going to be here when you&#39;re not.
(1145,1353)FRASIER
(721,1734)Then what&#39;s my problem? (CALLING)
(723,921)Daphne.
(416,921)2AÂ£EEE_BÂ§:EHIÂ§BÂ§-
(1144,1612)FRASIER (CONTâ€™D)
(721,1341)You&#39;ve been retained.
(1144,1318)DAPHNE
(720,1835)Oh, wonderful. I had a premonition I
(719,1624)would. I&#39;ll move my things in
(721,981)tomorrow.
(1145,1353)FRASIER
(720,1807)wait a minute. Move in? There must
(720,1838)be some misunderstanding. This isn&#39;t
(722,1281)a live-in position.
(1147,1321)DAPHNE
(722,1687)Oh dear. The lady at the agency
(725,922)said...
(1148,1354)FRASIER
(722,1686)Well, the lady at the agency was
(721,1831)wrong. This is a part-time position.
(723,1812)What a shame. We were getting along
(725,954)so well.
(425,1375)FRASIER STARTS TO USHER HER OUT.
(2205,2280)33. 
(J)
(1145,1322)MARTIN
(723,1747)Wait a minute, Frasier. I want to
(725,1356)talk about this. 
FRASIER
(728,1679)Dad, there&#39;s nothing to discuss.
(1152,1326)DAPHNE
(730,1812)I&#39;ll just pop back in here and enjoy
(730,1835)some more of your African erotic art.
(425,1329)DAPHNE HEADS FOR THE BATHROOM. 
MARTIN
(732,1691)Check out the one over the towel
(734,1694)rack. You gotta be young to try
(733,1365)that. 
FRASIER
(737,1659)Perhaps it&#39;s best if you leave.
(1162,1336)DAPHNE
(737,1371)Well, all right. 
FRASIER
(739,1613)We&#39;ll contact you. If not by
(741,1816)telephone, then through the toaster.
(437,1376)SHE EKITS. 
FRASIER
(749,1860)I am not having another person living
(750,1348)in this house. 
MARTIN
(749,1582)Give me one good reason why.
(1140,1346)FRASIER
(716,1773)Well, for one thing there&#39;s no room
(721,945)for her.
(1137,1313)MARTIN
(716,1768)What about the room across the hall
(720,1012)from mine?
(1138,1344)FRASIER
(715,1802)My study?! You expect me to give up
(715,1771)my study? Where I read, where I do
(715,1491)my most profound thinking?
(1137,1313)MARTIN
(716,1680)Use the can like the rest of the
(716,1607)world. (THEN) You&#39;ll adjust.
(1140,1345)FRASIER
(719,1741)I don&#39;t want to adjust. I&#39;ve done
(719,1824)enough adjusting. I&#39;m in a new city,
(720,1587)I have a new job, I&#39;m freshly
(718,1742)divorced and now my father and his
(719,1684)dog are living with me. I think
(720,1836)that&#39;s enough on my plate. The whole
(723,1774)idea of getting someone in here was
(721,1837)to help ease my burden, not to add to
(723,797)it.
(1141,1317)MARTIN
(723,1746)Did you hear that, Eddie? We&#39;re a
(721,920)burden.
(2201,2279)34. 
(J)
(1142,1347)FRASIER
(721,1707)Dad, you&#39;re twisting my words. I
(717,1709)meant burden in its most positive
(720,885)sense.
(1140,1317)MARTIN
(719,1826)Oh, as in "gee what a lovely burden?"
(1144,1349)FRASIER
(721,1460)Something like that, yes.
(1142,1318)MARTIN
(722,1805)Hey, you&#39;re not the only one getting
(725,1685)screwed here. Two years ago I&#39;m
(725,1746)sailing toward retirement and some
(724,1835)punk robbing a convenience store puts
(726,1778)a bullet in my hip. Next thing you
(725,1748)know, I&#39;m trading my golf clubs in
(729,1779)for one of these. (HE HOLDS UP THE
(726,1741)WALKER) I had a lot of plans too,
(728,1690)you know, and this may come as a
(731,1723)shock, Sonny Boy, but one of them
(729,1410)wasn&#39;t living with you.
(1155,1362)FRASIER
(735,1845)I&#39;m just trying to do the right thing
(733,1686)here, trying to be the good son.
(1157,1334)MARTIN
(735,1819)Oh, don&#39;t worry, after I&#39;m gone, you
(736,1699)can live guilt-free knowing that
(737,1661)you&#39;ve done right by your papa.
(2197,2274)35. 
(J)
(2212,2290)36. 
(J)
(1155,1359)FRASIER
(733,1719)That&#39;s what you think this is all
(734,1116)about, guilt?
(1151,1326)MARTIN
(735,997)Isn&#39;t it?
(1153,1356)FRASIER
(731,1837)of course it is! But the point is, I
(731,1840)did it. I took you in. And I&#39;ve got
(732,1771)news for you... I wanted to do it.
(732,1749)Because you&#39;re my father. And you
(731,1748)know how you repay me? Ever since
(730,1808)you moved in here, it&#39;s been a snide
(731,1808)comment about this or a smart little
(730,1839)put-down about that. Well, I&#39;ve done
(729,1749)my best to make a new home for you
(730,1749)here and once, just once, would it
(731,1716)have killed you to say thank you?
(731,1321)one lousy thank you?
(427,1324)THERE&#39;S A PAUSE. 
MARTIN
(732,1810)C&#39;mon, Eddie. It&#39;s past your dinner
(731,869)time.
(426,2137)HE AND EDDIE EXIT TO THE KITCHEN. FRASIER ANGRILY Eï¬liï¬,
(427,1285)SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.
(1635,1833)CUT TO:
(2201,2276)37.
(1229,1259)IN
(417,2075)A BLACK SCREEN. IN WHITE LETTERS APPEARS "LUPE VELEZ."

(1148,1353)FRASIER
(721,1751)They have got to move the bathroom
(723,1342)closer to the studio!
(420,2228)HE FLINGS HIMSELF INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS ON HIS HEADPHONES.
(420,1923)ROZ POINTS TO HIM. HE SPEAKS INTO THE MICROPHONE.
(1151,1619)FRASIER (CONTâ€™D)
(727,1631)I&#39;ll be right back after these
(724,987)messages.
(425,1469)HE PUNCHES A BUTTON ON THE CONSOLE.
(1149,1611)FRASIER (CONTâ€™D)
(736,1803)(TO Roz, IRRITATED) Could I perhaps
(725,1231)put that on tape?
(1146,1231)ROZ
(724,1260)What&#39;s eating you?
(1149,1354)FRASIER
(726,1743)This thing with my father and this
(727,1836)person he wants to hire... I thought
(731,1745)I was starting my life over with a
(729,1776)clean slate. I had this picture of
(729,1776)the way things were going to be and
(729,1346)then, I don&#39;t know...
(1150,1235)ROZ
(731,1472)Ever heard of Lupe Velez?
(1154,1359)FRASIER
(730,846)Who?
(1154,1238)ROZ
(735,1750)Lupe Velez. The movie star in the
(735,1844)thirties. The Mexican Spitfire. Her
(736,1783)career hit the skids so she decided
(736,1481)to take one final stab at
(740,1694)immortality. She figured if she
(737,1635)couldn&#39;t be remembered for her
(737,1786)movies, she&#39;d be remembered for the
(1171,1323)(MORE)
(2202,2281)33. 
(K)
(1125,1471)ROZ (CONTâ€™D)
(704,1728)way she died. And all Lupe wanted
(704,1758)was to be remembered. So she plans
(705,1595)this lavish suicide. Flowers,
(707,1697)candles, silk sheets, white satin
(706,1666)gown, full hair and make-up, the
(704,1667)works. She takes an overdose of
(706,1760)pills, lays on the bed and imagines
(707,1792)how beautiful she&#39;s going to look on
(707,1545)the front page of tomorrow&#39;s
(708,1792)newspaper. Unfortunately, the pills
(708,1731)didn&#39;t set well with the enchilada
(710,1733)combo plate she sadly chose as her
(711,1763)last meal. She stumbles toward the
(709,1795)bathroom, trips and falls head first
(714,1826)into the toilet. And that&#39;s how they
(716,1340)found her. 
FRASIER
(715,1768)Is there a reason you&#39;re telling me
(714,1220)this? 
ROZ
(716,1709)Yeah. Even though things may not
(716,1833)happen like we planned, they can work
(718,1035)out anyway.
(2190,2266)39. 
(K)
(2207,2286)40. 
(K)
(1153,1359)FRASIER
(728,1721)Remind me again how it worked for
(729,1811)Lupe, last seen with her head in the
(727,934)toilet?
(1150,1235)ROZ
(727,1801)All she wanted was to be remembered.
(738,1721)(BEAT) Will you egg; forget that
(731,905)story?
(424,2298)ROZ GOES BACK INTO HER BOOTH, LOOKS AT THE CLOCK AND POINTS AT
(427,656)FRASIER.
(1155,1360)FRASIER
(729,1754)Welcome back. Roz, who&#39;s our next
(731,1239)caller? 
ROZ
(730,1723)We have Martin on line one. He&#39;s
(731,1624)having a problem with his son.
(1158,1364)FRASIER
(733,1627)Hello, Martin. I&#39;m listening.
(1157,1536)MARTIN (v.o.)
(737,1447)I&#39;m a first time caller.
(434,1369)FRASIER STIFFENS. 
FRASIER
(736,1759)Welcome to the program. How can I
(738,1541)help you? 
MARTIN (v.o.)
(742,1815)I just moved in with my son and, uh,
(744,1794)it ain&#39;t working. There&#39;s a lot of
(741,1302)tension between us.
(1149,1352)FRASIER
(728,1686)I can imagine. Why do you think
(726,1020)that&#39;s so?
(1145,1519)MARTIN (v.o.)
(728,1774)I guess maybe I didn&#39;t see he had a
(726,1836)nice new life planned out for himself
(726,1582)and I kind of got in the way.
(1148,1352)FRASIER
(726,1775)You know these things are a two way
(727,1684)street. Perhaps your son wasn&#39;t
(727,1836)sensitive enough to see how your life
(725,1105)was changing.
(1146,1521)MARTIN (V.O.)
(727,1626)You got that right. I&#39;ve been
(727,1716)telling him that ever since I got
(727,896)there.
(1151,1355)FRASIER
(731,1799)I&#39;m sure he appreciated your candor.
(1149,1524)MARTIN (v.o.)
(731,1841)But maybe sometimes I&#39;ve got to learn
(729,1346)to keep my trap shut.
(1154,1358)FRASIER
(731,1621)That&#39;s good advice for us all.
(730,1147)Anything else?
(2205,2283)41. 
(K)
(1130,1509)MARTIN (v.o.)
(711,1795)I&#39;m worried my son doesn&#39;t know that
(711,1733)I really appreciate what he&#39;s done
(712,907)for me.
(1135,1342)FRASIER
(709,1398)Why don&#39;t you tell him?
(1133,1512)MARTIN (v.o.)
(712,1768)You know how it is with fathers and
(713,849)SOUS.
(921,1706)We always have a hard time
(715,1245)saying that stuff.
(712,851)Well,
(1138,1345)FRASIER
(898,1831)if it helps, I suspect your son
(715,1517)already knows how you feel.
(412,913)THERE IS A PAUSE.
(1141,1608)FRASIER (CONTâ€™D)
(719,1074)Is that all?
(721,1251)I guess that&#39;s it.
(721,888)Crane.
(1141,1518)MARTIN (V.O.)
(1323,1838)Thank you, Doctor
(1147,1353)FRASIER
(721,1314)My pleasure, Martin.
(725,1472)Did you hear what I said?
(1146,1524)MARTIN (v.o.)
(1543,1740)I said,
(724,1015)thank you.
(727,834)Yes,
(425,898)MARTIN HANGS UP.
(426,687)ANYTHING.
(1153,1359)FRASIER

(1143,1517)CLAIRE (V.O.)
(722,1710)I&#39;m, uh, well, I&#39;m a mess. Eight
(720,1802)months ago, my boyfriend and I broke
(721,1832)up and I can&#39;t get over it. The pain
(726,1773)isn&#39;t going away. It&#39;s almost like
(725,1193)I&#39;m in mourning.
(1147,1352)FRASIER
