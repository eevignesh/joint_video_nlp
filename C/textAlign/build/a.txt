00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,338:1:48
You follow her to work. You eavesdrop:2:89
on her calls. You open her mail.:2:111
:2:13
blah2:0
3:0:51
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,119:1:48
When you started doing these things,:2:87
the relationship was over.:2:116

we have Russell from Kirkland.:2:119
:2:13
blah6:0

00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,300:1:48
Hello, Russell, this is Dr Frasier Crane.:2:72
I'm listening.:2:73

:2:13
blah11:0
12:0:49
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,517:1:48
I'll cut to the chase:2:73
by using myself as an example.:2:98
:2:13
blah12:0
13:0:49
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,441:1:48
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.:2:83
:2:13
blah13:0
14:0:49
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,203:1:48
My wife had left me, which was:2:77
very painful.:2:118
:2:13
blah14:0
15:0:49
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,479:1:48
Then she came back to me,:2:84
which was excruciating.:2:119
:2:13
blah15:0
16:0:49
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,275:1:48
On top of that,:2:79
my practice had grown stagnant:2:109
:2:13
blah16:0
17:0:49
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:19,565:1:48
and my social life consisted:2:97
of hanging around a bar every night.:2:111
:2:13
blah17:0
18:0:49
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,909:1:48
I was clinging to a life:2:73
that wasn't working.:2:116

blah18:0
19:0:49
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,598:1:48
I knew I had to do something, anything.:2:73
:2:13
blah19:0
20:0:50
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:31,668:1:48
So I ended the marriage and moved:2:83
back here to my hometown of Seattle.:2:98
:2:13
blah20:0
21:0:50
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,200:1:48

blah21:0
22:0:50
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,381:1:48
I took action, Russell, and you can too.:2:73
:2:13
blah22:0
23:0:50
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:42,311:1:48
Move, change, do something.:2:77
If it's a mistake, do something else.:2:73
:2:13
blah23:0
24:0:50
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,995:1:48
Will you do that, Russell?:2:87

:2:13
blah28:0
29:0:50
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,408:1:48
I bare my soul to Seattle.:2:73
:2:13
blah29:0
30:0:51
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,939:1:48
They're listening to:2:84
Chopper Dave's Rush Hour Roundup!:2:67
:2:13
blah30:0
31:0:51
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,386:1:48
The rest of the show was pretty good.:2:84
It was a good show, wasn't it?:2:73
:2:13
blah31:0
32:0:51
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,712:1:48

blah32:0
33:0:51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,926:1:48
We call that "avoidance". Don't change:2:87
the subject. Tell me what you think.:2:116
:2:13
blah33:0
34:0:51
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,697:1:48
Did I ever tell you:2:68
what this button does?:2:119
:2:13
blah34:0
35:0:51
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,930:1:48
I am not a piece of Lalique.:2:73
:2:13
blah35:0
36:0:51
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,654:1:48
I can handle criticism.:2:73
How was I today?:2:72
:2:13
blah36:0
37:0:51
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,292:1:48
You dropped two commercials,:2:89
left a total of 28 seconds of dead air,:2:108
:2:13
blah37:0
38:0:51
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,563:1:48
scrambled the call letters,:2:115
spilt yoghurt on the control board,:2:115
:2:13
blah38:0
39:0:51
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,617:1:48
and you kept referring to Jerry,:2:97
with the identity crisis, as "Jeff".:2:119
:2:13
blah39:0
40:0:52
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,936:1:48

:2:13
blah40:0
41:0:52
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,573:1:48
So I said to the gardener,:2:83
"Yoshi, I do not want a Zen garden.:2:34

"I'll move to Yokohama.":2:34
:2:13
blah43:0
44:0:52
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,477:1:48
This offends him, so he starts:2:84
pulling up Maris' prized camellias.:2:112
:2:13
blah44:0
45:0:52
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,846:1:48
I couldn't stand for that.:2:73
:2:13
blah45:0
46:0:52
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:12,256:1:48
I marched inside and locked the door:2:73
until he cooled down.:2:117
:2:13
blah46:0
47:0:52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,897:1:48
Would you have handled it differently?:2:87
:2:13
blah47:0
48:0:52
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,348:1:48
Sorry, Niles.:2:83
I didn't realise you'd stopped talking.:2:73
:2:13
blah48:0
49:0:52

:2:13
blah53:0
54:0:53
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,642:1:48
And everything. When was the last:2:65
time you had an unexpressed thought?:2:116
:2:13
blah54:0
55:0:53
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,485:1:48

:2:13
blah65:0
66:0:54
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,502:1:48
One of his old police buddies called.:2:79

blah66:0
67:0:54
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,294:1:48

You're a florist.:2:89

blah231:0
232:0:50
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,704:1:48

Two years ago, some punk:2:84
robbing a store put a bullet in my hip.:2:114

blah253:0
254:0:50
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,649:1:48

blah254:0
255:0:50
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,328:1:48

blah257:0
258:0:50

Her career hit the skids so she decided:2:72

blah258:0
259:0:50
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,380:1:48

blah269:0
270:0:50
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:05,854:1:48

we planned, they can work out anyway.:2:119

blah270:0
271:0:50
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:13,703:1:48

Boston. My wife had left me, whichwas very painful, then she came back,which was excruciating. I thought Icould forgive her indiscretion butthere was this nagging little hint ofresentment, this minute lack ofempy line
trust, this overwhelming desire toshove a grapefruit in her face. Ontop of that, my practice had grownstagnant and my social life consistedof hanging around a bar night afternight. Suddenly I realized I wasclinging to a life that wasn'tempy line
working anymore. I knew I had to dosomething, anything. So I put an endto the marriage and moved back here tomy hometown of Seattle.
